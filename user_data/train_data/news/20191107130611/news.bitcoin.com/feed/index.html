<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wikileaks Shines a Light on Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satoshi&rsquo;s words were freighted with such a sense of foreboding that many believe they signified the writing on the wall; a sign that Nakamoto&rsquo;s tenure as Bitcoin figurehead had reached its inevitable end. His remark that Wikileaks had &ldquo;kicked the hornet&rsquo;s nest&rdquo; referred to the possibility of the controversial whistleblower website turning to bitcoin, after the U.S. government forced companies like Visa, Mastercard and Paypal to blockade the organization. According to an earlier post by Satoshi, the bitcoin project needed &ldquo;to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way,&rdquo; and the association with Wikileaks came too early in its development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a disoriented Julian Assange</span><a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2019/10/assange-in-court/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attempts to fight extradition to the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the British courts, having earlier claimed to have made a 50,000% return on bitcoin in the years following Satoshi&rsquo;s disappearance, it&rsquo;s interesting to look back to that period &ndash; December, 2010 &ndash; when Satoshi&rsquo;s retreat began and Wikileaks&rsquo; investment in bitcoin started being seriously discussed. This was a true fork in the road, significant not only to the history of bitcoin but also to state surveillance and those who would kick back at it.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-345077" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange-300x300.jpg" alt="Bitcoin History Part 19: WikiLeaks and the Hornet&rsquo;s Nest" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange-300x300.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange-150x150.jpg 150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange-768x768.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange-696x696.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange-420x420.jpg 420w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Man Who Kicked the Hornet&rsquo;s Nest</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might wonder why Bitcoin&rsquo;s founder was so alarmed by the news that Wikileaks was seeking to raise funds using the decentralized payment system. After all, bitcoin was designed to bypass gatekeepers and obviate the need for a central authority &ndash; and here was a perfect use case to prove its merits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1735.msg26999#msg26999"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a forum member positively touting Wikileaks&rsquo; embracement of bitcoin, published exactly one week before his final forum post, Satoshi said: &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t &ldquo;bring it on&rdquo;&hellip; Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem was very clear, as Satoshi saw it: unwanted government interest in the nascent digital currency was the last thing it needed at that point in time. And since just about every other payment gateway was refusing to process donations to Wikileaks, Julian Assange&rsquo;s solicitation of donations via bitcoin seemed to be a matter of time. At the very least, Satoshi wanted such a move to be discouraged &ndash; and he conveyed as much to Assange, as recounted by the latter in a 2014 Reddit</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2ghp54/i_am_julian_assange_ama_about_my_new_book_when/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Me Anything (AMA) session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and also in his book &ldquo;When Google Met WikiLeaks&rdquo;: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WikiLeaks read and agreed with Satoshi&rsquo;s analysis, and decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established. WikiLeaks&rsquo; Bitcoin donation address was launched after the currency&rsquo;s first major boom, on June 14, 2011.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the besieged organization opened the floodgates for bitcoin donations just two months after Satoshi&rsquo;s last ever correspondence &ndash; an</span><a href="https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshis-final-email-to-gavin-andresen/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to collaborator Gavin Andresen.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-345075" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks.jpg" alt="Bitcoin History Part 19: WikiLeaks and the Hornet&rsquo;s Nest" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks-696x464.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks-630x420.jpg 630w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wikileaks-190x128.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest, as they say, is history: Wikileaks received tens of millions of dollars in bitcoin donations between 2011 and 2018 (the exact figure continues to be disputed), Assange spent years in London&rsquo;s Ecuadorian embassy before being arrested, and in Satoshi&rsquo;s absence, Bitcoin was to kick many more hornets&rsquo; nests only to emerge, each time, stronger.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">An Opt-In System</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published a new regulatory framework for crypto exchanges on Wednesday. CEO Ashley Alder explained that the commission met with a number of crypto exchange operators after <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-cryptocurrency-industry/">unveiling a conceptual framework</a> that could be used to regulate crypto exchanges last year. &ldquo;After an in-depth examination of the unique technical and operational features of these platforms, we finally concluded that some could be regulated by us,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<figure id="attachment_345033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-345033" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-345033 size-full" title="Hong Kong Now Offers Opt-In Regulation to Crypto Exchanges" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alder.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Now Offers Opt-In Regulation to Crypto Exchanges" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alder.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alder-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alder-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alder-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alder-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-345033" class="wp-caption-text">SFC CEO Ashley Alder</figcaption></figure>
<p>The commission has been focusing on whether to regulate crypto exchanges. Alder elaborated, &ldquo;We saw this as a priority because this type of platform has proliferated in Hong Kong and up to now has largely escaped any form of regulation,&rdquo; adding that it is largely because crypto assets fall outside the legal definition of securities and futures contracts. Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not securities and &ldquo;nothing in our new framework alters this position,&rdquo; he admitted that the SFC can only regulate those platforms that choose to include at least one security crypto asset or token for trading. &ldquo;But once this happens our new rules will apply to all platform operations, even if the vast majority of other virtual assets traded on the platform are not securities.&rdquo; The CEO clarified:</p>
<blockquote><p>So this, essentially, is a framework allowing a platform operator to opt-in to regulation &hellip; Once licenses are granted to those platforms which choose to opt-in, investors will then be able to distinguish easily between properly regulated platforms, and all the rest.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-345036 aligncenter" title="Hong Kong Now Offers Opt-In Regulation to Crypto Exchanges" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opt-in.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Now Offers Opt-In Regulation to Crypto Exchanges" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opt-in.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opt-in-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opt-in-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opt-in-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/opt-in-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What the Regulation Entails</h2>
<p>The SFC detailed in its &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/web/EN/files/ER/PDF/20191106%20Position%20Paper%20and%20Appendix%201%20to%20Position%20Paper%20(Eng).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Position Paper</a>&rdquo; published on Wednesday the rules and requirements for crypto trading platforms to be regulated. The commission also emphasized that only centralized platforms in Hong Kong that provide crypto trading, clearing, and settlement services will be considered for licensing. Applications from peer-to-peer marketplaces will not be accepted at this time. The SFC confirmed:</p>
<blockquote><p>As from 6 November 2019, a firm which operates a centralized virtual asset trading platform in Hong Kong and intends to offer trading of at least one security token on this platform may apply for a license from the SFC for Types 1 and 7 regulated activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Type 1 license is for dealing in securities and the Type 7 is for automated trading services (ATS) activities. The commission also requires all trading activities of its licensees, including those conducted by their group companies, to be carried out under a single, SFC-licensed legal entity. The regulator explained that not only will it allow for comprehensive oversight, but it also &ldquo;minimizes any uncertainty about which parts of the business are licensed and supervised by the SFC.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-345038 aligncenter" title="Hong Kong Now Offers Opt-In Regulation to Crypto Exchanges" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sfc.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Now Offers Opt-In Regulation to Crypto Exchanges" width="1000" height="352" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sfc.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sfc-300x106.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sfc-768x270.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sfc-696x245.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Further, licensees are required to obtain prior written approval from the SFC for any plan or proposal such as for introducing or offering a new or incidental product or service, or to make a material change to an existing service or activity. Licensees must also provide monthly reports to the commission and engage an independent professional firm to review their activities and operations annually.</p>
<p>The Position Paper also outlines licensing conditions, the first of which details who can trade on licensed platforms. The SFC noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The licensee must only provide services to professional investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The definition of a professional investor is extensive; it includes an individual, a partnership or a corporation with a portfolio of at least 8 million HKD (~$1 million) or equivalent, or a trust corporation with total assets of at least 40 million HKD or equivalent.</p>

<p>For the safe custody of assets, the SFC requires licensees &ldquo;to ensure that an insurance policy covering the risks associated with the custody of virtual assets held in both hot storage (full coverage) and cold storage (a substantial coverage, eg, 95%) is in effect at all times.&rdquo; Licensed platform operators and their associated entities must also store 98% of client crypto assets in cold wallets and limit the amount stored in hot wallets to 2%. The commission also expects them &ldquo;to set up and implement strong internal controls and governance procedures for private key management to ensure all cryptographic seeds and keys are securely generated, stored and backed up.&rdquo; Moreover, the SFC added:</p>
<blockquote><p>A virtual asset trading platform operator, upon becoming licensed, will be placed in the SFC Regulatory Sandbox. This would typically mean more frequent reporting, monitoring and reviews.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many more conditions that must be met, including complying with the SFC code of conduct and having adequate measures for know-your-client (KYC), anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), preventing market manipulation and abusive activities, accounting and auditing, and risk management.</p>

Since the inception of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, there&rsquo;s been a number of full node clients that not only distribute important binary data but offer a variety of different features as well. One such project is the Bitcoin Cash validator and database created by Tom Zander called Flowee the Hub, a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> client that aims to be a multi-service node that offers a myriad of functionality. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Flowee the Hub</h2>
<p>When Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin codebase in 2009 he wrote the protocol using the programming language C++, but Bitcoin itself can conform to any language and any full node implementation that follows the consensus rules. Bitcoin Cash has 1,525 public nodes running <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and there are five different <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> full nodes, according to <a href="https://cash.coin.dance/nodes">Coin Dance statistics</a>. At the moment there&rsquo;s Bitcoin ABC, BCHD, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Verde, and <a href="https://flowee.org">Flowee the Hub</a>. The project Flowee is a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> validator and database created by blockchain developer Tom Zander.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344939 size-full" title="Meet Flowee the Hub: A Feature-Rich Bitcoin Cash Validator" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/me1mpz_wlvthgoc8l4z6sagyxpjrs5y2gjfg3bmdupw.jpg" alt="Meet Flowee the Hub: A Feature-Rich Bitcoin Cash Validator" width="250" height="164"></p>
<p>The full node client validates <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> transactions so users and organizations can verify the data as factual. The software can forward transactions and provide a record of incoming transactions as well, giving the Flowee user real-time data. Beyond the full node operations, Flowee also offers foundational support for applications. Essentially Flowee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hub&rsquo; is a full suite of application program interfaces (APIs) or a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building with Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>When Zander <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7sohuh/introducing_flowee_the_hub/">introduced</a> the platform to the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> community he explained how he created Flowee in order to produce an infinitely scalable client that can &ldquo;talk to the blockchain in an easy to understand API.&rdquo; &ldquo;No fussing with other people&rsquo;s software or unreliable third parties,&rdquo; the platform&rsquo;s website explains. &ldquo;Flowee lets you process or create Bitcoin Cash payments within your own applications.&rdquo; The developer known as &lsquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/im_uname">Imaginary Username</a>&rsquo; described Flowee in a very succinct way when the project was first established. The software engineer <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7sohuh/introducing_flowee_the_hub/dt6hl4k/">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>For the people needing a TL;DR: Tom Zander is looking to build a &ldquo;full-service&rdquo; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> node that integrates various useful functions at a more basic level (that make explorer et. al. easier to deploy and run), has native multithreading to get over the block/tx validation problem, has memory-mapped blocks to reduce RAM usage (so gigabyte blocks can be deployed painlessly) and can be easily managed. Imagine having the Bitpay infrastructure under one roof, on a GPL license.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Cash Can Scale</h2>
<p>Flowee has four different paths: <a href="https://flowee.org/hub/">the hub</a>, an <a href="https://flowee.org/indexer/">indexer</a>, a <a href="https://flowee.org/vulcano/">transaction &lsquo;vulcano</a>,&rsquo; and a point-of-sale system called the <a href="https://flowee.org/cashier/">Flowee Cashier</a> that&rsquo;s under construction. Essentially, the indexer allows people to obtain indexes from the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> chain in a fast manner. &ldquo;Indexer is a stand-alone service you can deploy on one (or more) machines and they create an index of the most important details of the transactions database that the hub stores,&rdquo; the indexer documentation details. &ldquo;This allows you to &lsquo;follow the money,&rsquo; as it were. Any department that wants to do any sort of client followup towards payments will want to have access to an indexer.&rdquo; The transaction vulcano (txVulcano) is a test tool designed to &ldquo;create massive amounts of transactions.&rdquo; According to the documentation, the transaction vulcano&rsquo;s main focus is to mine blocks and use the block reward to create more transactions with more inputs. The vulcano process continues in a repetitive cycle in order to process extremely large blocks.</p>
<p>In March, the Flowee developer revealed that the project was &ldquo;stress tested and used to create big blocks for a week.&rdquo; Zander <a href="https://twitter.com/FloweeTheHub/status/1110155582747672576">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>1.2 million transactions in 400MB processed in 45 seconds.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344948 size-full" title="Meet Flowee the Hub: A Feature-Rich Bitcoin Cash Validator" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flowterrsfsffd.jpg" alt="Meet Flowee the Hub: A Feature-Rich Bitcoin Cash Validator" width="880" height="400" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flowterrsfsffd.jpg 880w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flowterrsfsffd-300x136.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flowterrsfsffd-768x349.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flowterrsfsffd-696x316.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"></p>
<p>Flowee the Hub is open source and the code can be <a href="https://gitlab.com/FloweeTheHub/thehub">found on Gitlab</a> and reference documentation is available on <a href="https://flowee.org/docs/hub/">docs/hub</a>. Just recently Flowee published the 2019-09 release, which offers APIs and features support for the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-proponents-prepare-for-forthcoming-upgrade-features/">November 15 upgrade</a>. The latest Flowee version specifications can be reviewed <a href="https://flowee.org/releases/201909-release/">here</a> and people are <a href="https://twitter.com/FloweeTheHub/status/1186260367397343233">urged to upgrade</a> the software as soon as possible before the upgrade. Zander noted on November 6 that installing the latest Flowee release was a breeze. &ldquo;I installed Flowee the Hub on a simple server last night and the initial block sync took only 2 hours,&rdquo; the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/FloweeTheHub/status/1192037780374917121">tweeted</a>. &ldquo;Processing the entire 11-year block history &mdash; I think this is a good prove that Bitcoin Cash can scale already very well, thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flowee is a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> implementation that has been out for quite some time and the software aims to bolster scaling while also offering a suite of services. While Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited are the dominant nodes, other <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> clients offer people a choice while providing different sets of features as well. For example, <a href="https://bchd.cash/">BCHD</a> is a full node <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> implementation written in Go (golang) that provides an advanced API, adjustable blocksize cap, BIP 157/158, BIP 68, and other features. <a href="https://github.com/softwareverde/bitcoin-verde">Bitcoin Verde</a> is a full node client that was built from the ground up and offers a <a href="http://bitcoinverde.org/">block explorer</a> and library. Multiple clients like Flowee and other <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> implementations can provide developers creating <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> apps and other types of platforms the tools they need to create robust products and services while speeding up their workflow.

Since then, Dotcom&rsquo;s team disclosed there would be an exchange sale for Kimcoin token on the digital asset exchange Bitfinex. However, Bitfinex and the K.im platform team say that &ldquo;regulatory uncertainty&rdquo; has caused them to postpone the sale. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Kim Dotcom&rsquo;s K.im Token Sale Delayed Indefinitely</h2>
<p>The token sale for the K.im platform is being postponed according to a blog post from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. K.im is a project that was created by the notorious Kim Dotcom, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-daily-consensys-acquires-planetary-resources-new-zealand-backs-crypto/">New Zealand</a> resident who once operated the popular file-sharing site Megaupload. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) seized the website and charged Dotcom with copyright infringement. Since then, Dotcom has been a <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom">popular socialite</a> on Twitter and is well known for his appreciation for cryptocurrencies like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>

<p>For instance, on October 31, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-bitcoins-peer-to-peer-cash-system-was-revealed-11-years-ago/">11th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper</a>, Dotcom <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1190041168362590208">tweeted</a> that &ldquo;crypto is all about freedom.&rdquo; Over the last few years, the former Megaupload boss has been working on a project called <a href="https://k.im">K.im,</a> a platform designed so users can upload content and be rewarded with small fractions of bitcoin micropayments. News.Bitcoin.com was invited to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/an-inside-look-at-kim-dotcoms-upcoming-bitcache-and-k-im-platform/">privately demo</a> the application in August 2017 but the K.im project hasn&rsquo;t been officially released and people can only demo the app.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344981 size-full" title="Kim Dotcom Token Sale Postponed Over 'Regulatory Uncertainty'" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900.jpg" alt="Kim Dotcom Token Sale Postponed Over 'Regulatory Uncertainty'" width="3200" height="900" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900.jpg 3200w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-300x84.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-768x216.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-1024x288.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-696x196.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-1392x392.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-1068x300.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kimmy6900-1493x420.jpg 1493w" sizes="(max-width: 3200px) 100vw, 3200px"></p>
<p>Dotcom&rsquo;s team also used the fundraising platform <a href="https://bnktothefuture.com/pitches/k-im-and-bitcache">bnktothefuture.com</a> and raised $1,061,696 from 330 investors. The project&rsquo;s elevator pitch explained that Dotcom&rsquo;s blockchain platform would aim to provide better privacy and leverage the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> chain to glue the foundation together. Additionally, the K.im platform and Bitcache would use other blockchain solutions like storj and maidsafe. In September 2019, the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://k.im/download/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> disclosed that the K.im project would use a native token called Kimcoin to facilitate access to the content held on the network. The whitepaper revealed that Kimcoin was not going to be mined but minted using the Liquid network, a federated sidechain developed by Blockstream. The file-sharing platform would allow users to utilize <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> payments but Kimcoin was said to have more of an advantage because it&rsquo;s less cumbersome. Kimcoin would also have other perks and a rewards program.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitfinex and the K.im Team Mutually Agree Not to Hold Token Sale at This Time</h2>
<p>Kimcoins were supposed to be sold on Bitfinex on October 22 and the coin would eventually be listed on the exchange in Q3 2020. However, on November 5, Bitfinex <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/430">told potential investors</a> that the token sale would be delayed because of regulatory concerns. &ldquo;Since we announced the debut of Kimcoin on the Bitfinex Token Sale platform, the regulatory environment has rapidly evolved,&rdquo; the exchange wrote. &ldquo;The risks associated with raising funds for the K.im token sale have become clear, and we must put our community&rsquo;s best interest first and foremost.&rdquo; The news follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-imposes-multimillion-dollar-fine-for-unregistered-eos-token-sale/">recent SEC fines</a> given to projects like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a> and Siacoin. The project Igobit and its founder was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/president-purported-intergovernmental-organization-indicted-cryptocurrency-scheme">charged</a> by the DoJ on November 6 for &ldquo;participation in an investment scheme tied to a purported digital coin offering.&rdquo; The Kimcoin token sale organizers may have decided to cancel after the domino effect of ICO-based criminal charges and court settlements in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After careful evaluation, we regret to announce that Bitfinex Token Sales and the K.im team have mutually agreed not to hold the token sale at this time,&rdquo; Bitfinex disclosed. &ldquo;K.im will defer any decision on whether to create tokens on, or undertake a token issue in relation to the K.im platform until it is fully functional,&rdquo; Bitfinex added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>In the meantime, the K.im platform project itself will continue and it is likely that an equity-based offer will be made some time in the near future to qualifying investors who wish to become involved at this stage of the project.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Dotcom&rsquo;s platform has been in the making for a very long time and has seen quite a few hurdles along the way. For three years, people have been waiting to see the project unfold but now have to wait even longer because of the regulatory opacity. The project&rsquo;s roadmap shows that with the token sale being pushed off, it may delay other projected accomplishments like Liquid network integration slated for Q1 2020, K.im application services and prototyping, and the official Kimcoin launch that was supposed to happen in Q3 2020.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">zk-Snarks</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">zk-Snarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are best known for their use in privacy coin protocols such as Zcash. These &ldquo;zero knowledge proofs&rdquo; have far broader applications than simply masking the sender and receiver when transmitting crypto via a public ledger. A zero-knowledge proof allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information about the statement itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To break this down into a simple analogy, imagine that Farmer Bob is selling some livestock at the market. He wishes to prove to the auctioneer that there is a cow in his trailer, but without opening the door (cos then the creature would escape). Using a heat sensor installed inside the trailer, Bob can prove that there is a living, breathing animal inside, but the auctioneer will have no way of knowing which cow it is, or even whether the animal is a cow (unless it moos and gives the game away). That, essentially, is how a zk-Snark operates: proof that something is true, while disclosing zero knowledge about the thing in question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for how zk-Snarks can be deployed outside of privacy coin transactions, look no further than smart contracts. </span><a href="https://quras.io/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quras</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, is using the technology to provision privacy-enabled smart contracts that run on its eponymous VM. Applications include concealing information pertaining to credit history; enabling healthcare and medical information from IoT devices to be shared confidentially; and facilitating sealed auctions that are executed using smart contracts.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-344909" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/quras-300x87.jpg" alt="Conceal and Reveal: The Evolution of Privacy Coin Technology" width="300" height="87" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/quras-300x87.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/quras-768x222.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/quras-696x201.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/quras.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammad Mazen is the CEO of </span><a href="https://burency.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain research and development platform. Expounding on why private smart contracts are desirable, he told news.Bitcoin.com: &ldquo;Smart contracts have the potential to automate business processes ranging from calculating insurance premiums to powering decentralized synthetics markets, but for this to happen, there needs to be privacy built in. Broadcasting information on-chain nullifies any benefits that might otherwise have been gained through using blockchain, since publicly verifiable smart contracts enable observers to frontrun markets and steal competitors&rsquo; proprietary algorithms. Privacy technology provides a means to conceal the secret sauce that&rsquo;s in a smart contract, while still enabling its integrity to be verified.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-345063" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/screenshot-2019-11-07-at-08-11-58.png" alt="" width="208" height="238"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimblewimble</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">zk-Snarks aren&rsquo;t the only privacy technology whose applications extend far beyond those originally envisioned by its pseudonymous creator. The origins of Mimblewimble don&rsquo;t need retelling again, but its evolution does. Although utilized by both Grin and Beam &ndash; and soon Litecoin too &ndash; it is the Beam iteration of Mimblewimble that has applications for the broadest range of users. Understanding how Mimblewimble works isn&rsquo;t easy, unless you&rsquo;re au fait with elliptic curve cryptography. Even Beam&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://medium.com/beam-mw/how-mimblewimble-works-18ea3980cffe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at explaining the process via a series of dumbed down metaphors takes some digesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&rsquo;s relevant here isn&rsquo;t so much the way in which Mimblewimble works, but the fact that it can provide complete transactional anonymity between parties while being compatible with implementations such as Beam that enable optional audibility. Digitally signed documentation can be attached to transactions, giving an approved auditor permission to view the transactions associated with a particular key. For cypherpunks intent on concealing their activity from snooping governments, that ability will be of little interest, but for businesses that wish to conceal their day-to-day affairs from the public (paying staff, contractors, and purchasing goods) while still remaining compliant from an accounting perspective, it&rsquo;s extremely useful.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-344906" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy.jpg" alt="Conceal and Reveal: The Evolution of Privacy Coin Technology" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy-696x464.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy-630x420.jpg 630w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/privacy-190x128.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulletproofs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulletproofs are actually part of the zero-knowledge proofs family and allow multiple range proofs from different parties to be aggregated into one proof. What this means, in practice, is that bulletproofs allow for information to be significantly compressed without compromising its validity. When integrated into Monero last year, for example, bulletproofs slashed transaction fees through reducing the average size of each transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a number of interesting applications for bulletproofs outside of facilitating confidential transactions. They can be used in proof of solvency, for instance, with one research paper </span><a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/bulletproofs-and-mimblewimble/MainReport.html#bulletproofs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &ldquo;A Bitcoin exchange with 2 million customers needs approximately 18GB to prove solvency in a confidential manner &hellip; Using Bulletproofs and its variant protocols &hellip; this size could be reduced to approximately 62MB.&rdquo; The same paper lists a total of eight use cases for bulletproofs, including smart contracts and crypto derivatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy coin tech follows the same adoption curve as other disruptive technologies: first it&rsquo;s used by criminals, outlaws, and geeks. Then by enterprises, ordinary end users and even governments. Just as it was with encryption, so it is proving to be with privacy-preserving tech: from unknown to ostracized to indispensable in under a decade.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mining Not to Be &lsquo;Eliminated&rsquo;</h2>
<p>The Industrial Structure Adjustment Guidance Catalog, issued by China&rsquo;s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has lost a reference to crypto mining activities. This is actually good news as a draft released earlier this year had mining among industries that Beijing wanted local administrations to get rid of. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean mining is legal, but it is less illegal,&rdquo; a Chinese miner contacted by news.Bitcoin.com remarked confirming the news.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344923 size-full" title="China Removes Bitcoin Mining From Unwanted Industries List" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1207960612.jpg" alt="China Removes Bitcoin Mining From Unwanted Industries List" width="999" height="549" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1207960612.jpg 999w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1207960612-300x165.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1207960612-768x422.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1207960612-696x382.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1207960612-764x420.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></p>
<p>The final version of the document, which was <a href="http://www.ndrc.gov.cn/gzdt/201911/W020191106310206237723.pdf">published</a> this week, will enter into force in January 2020. The catalog lists industries that regional authorities are advised to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The initial policy proposal prepared by the central government agency in April reportedly mentioned virtual currency mining in the &lsquo;eliminate&rsquo; category.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ndrc.gov.cn/">NDRC</a>, formerly the State Development Planning Commission, is responsible for macroeconomic management. It operates under the State Council, which is China&rsquo;s main administrative authority controlling the country&rsquo;s economy. The commission formulates policies for economic and social development and guides restructuring efforts. With around two dozen departments and agencies under its umbrella, it effectively functions as a mini version of the Chinese government.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">China&rsquo;s Dominance in Bitcoin Minting</h2>
<p>Cheap electrical energy and suitable climate have turned China into a hotspot for the business of minting digital coins. The People&rsquo;s Republic is a global leader in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-big-hydro-power-partners-with-bitcoin-miners-to-prevent-energy-waste/">bitcoin mining</a> with Chinese pools controlling around 70% of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> network&rsquo;s collective hashrate. The most populous country is home to the world&rsquo;s largest mining operations and mining hardware manufacturers such as Beijing-based Bitmain.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344924 size-full" title="China Removes Bitcoin Mining From Unwanted Industries List" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_763058236.jpg" alt="China Removes Bitcoin Mining From Unwanted Industries List" width="1000" height="549" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_763058236.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_763058236-300x165.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_763058236-768x422.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_763058236-696x382.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_763058236-765x420.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The Chinese government has treated various crypto-related business activities differently. While cryptocurrency exchanges and coin offering projects were effectively banned from the mainland, authorities have largely turned a blind eye to digital currency mining. What&rsquo;s more, in regions such as Sichuan, mining farms utilize electricity from state-owned hydropower plants even under contractual arrangements, as news.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-big-hydro-power-partners-with-bitcoin-miners-to-prevent-energy-waste/">reported</a> during the rainy season this summer. This year&rsquo;s crypto market recovery made <a href="https://mining.bitcoin.com/">bitcoin mining</a> profitable again and anyone can participate without having to acquire mining equipment thanks to services offered by platforms such as the <a href="https://mining.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com Pool</a>.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s role, both in the traditional economy and the crypto space, has been growing for years but the ongoing trade war with the U.S. forced the country to intensify the search for alternative paths of development. A recent Politburo <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-chinas-new-fascination-with-blockchain-really-good-for-bitcoin/">speech</a> by the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping, indicated that Beijing has decided to put blockchain in the focus of these efforts. And although China has never been particularly friendly to <a href="https://buy.bitcoin.com/">decentralized cryptocurrencies</a>, it&rsquo;s developing a digital yuan instead, and crypto markets have reacted positively to the move that many in the industry view as a bullish step.</p>

The latest video from Bitcoin.com shows how <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> is used to buy anything from drinks at the bar to equity in a venture safely and easily.<br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Using Cryptocurrency at the Bar</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin.com team recently attended a bitcoin cash meetup at Brewdog in London to sample some of the BCH-fueled nightlife the British capital has to offer. A short video with highlights from the event showcases how cryptocurrency is used by real people to make payments today for everyday purchases such as drinks at the bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZDROlftMh8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The London meetup also gave a chance for new people to learn about using the <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com Wallet</a> for fast, cheap and reliable payments firsthand. They got on the spot, real money demonstrations from the team including the company&rsquo;s top leadership of Executive Chairman Roger Ver and CEO Stefan Rust.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Equity for Punks</h2>
<p>One interesting highlight from the Brewdog meetup video is seeing how CEO Stefan Rust bought shares in the craft brewer with bitcoin cash right at the bar. In July of this year Brewdog, which had already been selling <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brewdog-brand-welcomes-bitcoin-cash-to-its-flagship-london-bar/">beers for BCH</a> since 2018, revealed that the public can also invest in the company using cryptocurrency. It has a crew of over 1,500 employees, 80 locations worldwide with two breweries in Ellon, Scotland and Columbus, Ohio that export to 60 markets globally.</p>
<p>The brewery&rsquo;s crowdfunding project, &ldquo;Equity for Punks,&rdquo; has been extended until April 2020 and accepts bitcoin core (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), omisego (OMG), qtum (QTUM), augur (REP), 0x (ZRX), bitcoin SV (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a>), ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>), and ripple (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>). Shares in Brewdog cost &pound;25 each and can be redeemed through the company&rsquo;s website. It had already raised over &pound;72 million from more than 114,000 people around the world before opening up the crypto option.</p>

<p>James Watt, Captain of Brewdog, stated at the time: &ldquo;Our Equity Punks are our community, our shareholders and our friends and the driving force behind our business. The growth BrewDog has shown over the last decade could only have been achieved with their encouragement and support and together we have shown the city slickers what can be achieved with taking charge of something you believe in. Cryptocurrency is exactly the same. If you embrace change to subvert the mainstream we are in your corner; whether your weapons of choice are malt, hops, yeast and water or blockchain.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Join a Bitcoin Cash Meetup</h2>
<p>If you want to join a similar event, you&rsquo;ll find many local bitcoin cash meetups available all over the world at Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Events</a> page. You can use the map tool to zoom in on your area to see what meetups are available nearby, or just search the directory listing them by continents, countries, cities and so on.</p>
<p>You can also create a new bitcoin cash meetup yourself. If you need help with this, on the same page you have the option to contact the Bitcoin.com team for support in setting up your new group and getting more people to join meetings based on their experience. Offering drinks for crypto can probably help with getting more people onboard.</p>
<p>An additional way to find bitcoin cash meetups or to see how successful ones are organized is to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/BCHmeetups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BCHMeetups</a> on Twitter. This profile routinely publishes posts on <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCH</a> gatherings happening in many different countries, information on where people can find meetups in their area, as well as pictures and stories from events that have already taken place.</p>

The Simple Ledger Protocol provides electronic wallets, block explorers, social media bots, token faucets and back-end infrastructure, as well as protocols for token creation and consulting for token resources and development.</p>
<p>Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) and Simplified Tokenization</p>
<p>As tokenization is slowly but steadily gaining in popularity thanks to transparency and increased functionality in terms of storing and distributing value, the Simple Ledger Protocol offers a simplified and efficient way of tokenizing assets with greater integrity as opposed to traditional forms of asset trading and accounting. Any value can be tokenized and SLP offers the right tools for the tokenization of gaming assets, gift cards, digital media rights, company stocks and shares, creating a highly functional digital market. SLP tokens are created on the Simple Ledger Protocol that is built on the Bitcoin Cash chain, enabling prompt and efficient management, token creation and trading. SLP tokens on the Bitcoin Cash chain are equivalent to ERC20 type tokens on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>SLP provides efficiency, integrity and transparency through enabling support for light wallets, full audibility for on-chain transactions, simplified token systems with user-friendly tools, token loss prevention, flexible issuance, multi-signature addresses and peer-to-peer exchange of tokenized value within a permissionless environment.</p>

Through this implementation, Tokens.net is joining the broader market of digital assets with SLP implementation, towards bringing tokenization to broad masses.

The company had already begun disabling user capabilities prior to the notice. Traders have until November 13 to move their assets from the exchange, and the Huobi blog post details the protocol as well as how to sign up for the U.S.-compliant version, Huobi US.</p>
<p>While the creation of and migration to U.S.-specific exchanges for compliance purposes is not unusual, a Hong Kong-based source and OTC trader informs news.Bitcoin.com that there is more to the story, and it is not only U.S.-based traders who should be concerned.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Government Management of the Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>The source most notably told news.Bitcoin.com that according to an insider, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is stepping into managerial positions at popular crypto exchange Huobi:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s the fact. Already have CCP members take role as huobi management.</p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Volatile Backdrop</h2>
<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-now-censors-anti-blockchain-sentiment-educates-public-on-bitcoin/">reported</a>, the Chinese government also appears to now be censoring criticism of &rdquo;blockchain&rdquo;. President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-ranks-35-crypto-projects-as-president-xi-pushes-blockchain/">public promotion</a> of the technology, coupled with a focus on development of the nation&rsquo;s own central bank digital currency &mdash; known as the digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system &mdash; adds further context to the Hong Kong trader&rsquo;s reports. &ldquo;Also president Xi announced China will put more resources into crypto space,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>With the situation in Hong Kong volatile, fear among crypto traders is pronounced and some worry markets will be overtaken. According to the anonymous source, the CCP is moving to:</p>
<blockquote><p>Take every leading company in the [financial] industry. Alibaba. Tencent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement hearkens to events in early October, when Alipay <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-launches-p2p-trading-in-china-with-support-for-alipay-and-wechat/">tweeted</a>: &ldquo;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">There&rsquo;re several reports about </span><span class="r-18u37iz">@Alipay </span>being used for bitcoin transactions. To reiterate, Alipay closely monitors over-the-counter transactions to identify irregular behavior and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Major Bank Fraud Crackdown</h2>
<p>The Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) carried out searches at over 190 bank locations nationwide on Tuesday, local media reported. An officer of the bureau said that the CBI has registered 42 new scam cases involving Rs 7,200 crore (~$1 billion). PTI reported that CBI&rsquo;s teams knocked on doors of the accused to collect evidence and question them, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The operation was spread across 16 states and union territories with as many as 1,000 officers of the agency involved in it making it one of the largest coordinated searches this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Out of these 42 cases, there are 4 cases of more than Rs 1,000 crore and 11 cases of fraud amount of Rs 100 crore to Rs 1000 crore,&rdquo; a statement issued by the CBI reveals. &ldquo;During searches, incriminating documents have been recovered so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344828 aligncenter" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cbi.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cbi.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cbi-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cbi-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cbi-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cbi-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The statement further details that most of the loan fraud cases were detected at 15 banks, including the State Bank of India (SBI), the country&rsquo;s largest government-owned lender. The other banks involved were Andhra Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Indian Overseas Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Dena Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, Union Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, and Bank of India, Business Today detailed.</p>
<p>The searches were conducted throughout Tuesday, most of which were in Maharashtra where 58 bank locations were raided, followed by Punjab with 32 branches searched. Other searches were carried out in New Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Kerala, Telangana and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Gujarat and Haryana, Karnataka and Uttarakhand, and West Bengal.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">PMC Bank Fraud Case Continues</h2>
<p>A recent, widely-publicized fraud case involving one of the largest cooperative banks in the country is still ongoing. Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, with 137 branches in multiple states, was put under regulatory restrictions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/panic-at-137-bank-branches-as-rbi-limits-withdrawals-to-1000/">September</a>, limiting customer withdrawals to 100 rupees for six months.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344836 aligncenter" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rbi.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rbi.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rbi-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rbi-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rbi-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rbi-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The withdrawal limit has been increased <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-crisis-spreads-in-india-deaths-strike-supreme-court-denial/">several times</a>, following protests and court petitions. On Nov. 5, the central bank raised the limit to 50,000 rupees, but some depositors are still battling with the central bank to gain access to all of their money. In the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-raided-arrests-made-but-rbi-still-restricts-withdrawals/">PMC fraud case</a>, bank officials allegedly created more than 12,000 fictitious accounts to cover up bad loans worth approximately Rs 4,300.</p>
<p>Last year, India&rsquo;s second-biggest state-controlled lender, Punjab National Bank, was hit by a $2 billion fraud scandal. The RBI said in June that over 6,800 cases of bank fraud involving an unprecedented Rs 71,500 crore (~$10 billion) have been reported in 2018-19.</p>
