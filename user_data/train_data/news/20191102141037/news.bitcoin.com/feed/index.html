<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Real-Life Political Cartoon</h2>
<p>Not so long ago people used to joke about the typical shyster politician and their larger than life campaign promises. Wisecracks about the next White House wannabe centered around grease-ball politicians literally throwing money at voters to buy their support. Well now, under the guise of a hip new presidential campaign, the money throwing is actually happening. To critique Andrew Yang is no easy task, given the understandable and dynamic support he&rsquo;s received against the backdrop of a totally corrupt and greedy political and financial system. It stands to ask, though: Is he really set to change things? Upon closer examination, UBI is little more than an inept and unethical ploy for socioeconomic power.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">If it feels this good to give 10 Americans $1,000 a month imagine how it will feel to do the same for hundreds of millions of us. It will be one of the greatest days in human history.</p>
<p>&mdash; Andrew Yang&#129506; (@AndrewYang) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1190114235336003587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Generous (With Other People&rsquo;s Money)</h2>
<p>Math. It&rsquo;s a discipline unlike others for its exact answers and lack of room for debate. One plus one is two. There&rsquo;s not much dissent possible here, outside of the occasional stoner drum circle or deep metaphysical fireside discussion. Nothing wrong with either, of course, but this is just to lay the groundwork for an argument. Namely, that one cannot give away value one doesn&rsquo;t have. While Yang is currently giving a &ldquo;Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families&rdquo; out of his own pocket, once in office that money set to &ldquo;do the same for hundreds of millions of us&rdquo; will come from your pockets.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mixed Up Math</h2>
<p>Yang&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/">campaign website</a> lays out the groundwork for his proposed &ldquo;Freedom Dividend.&rdquo; While a dividend is usually defined as a share of profits paid out to shareholders, Yang&rsquo;s &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; will be made possible &ldquo;by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent.&rdquo; Not exactly a share of profits as much as money pulled from the pockets of Americans, but for the sake of argument, that will do for now. In assuaging fears of inflation, negative economic impact and even incoming communism, Yang maintains on the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for bank bailouts in its quantitative easing program with no inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This assessment is massively dishonest, and if not, massively ignorant of basic economic realities. It ignores math, in other words. There are many types of inflation and some of the most pernicious hide beneath the surface of popular reference. While consumer price index inflation (CPI) may appear almost unaffected during some periods of quantitative easing (QE) due to a mix of market factors (including the psychological aspect of consumer confidence), asset price inflation is the real trigger for more serious problems. In other words, even as the debt racket of modern government paper spirals out of control, if the people are confident in their money and the state&rsquo;s reassurance of its value, CPI may stay relatively stable, and businesses will be unable to increase prices due to this psychology and other factors such as healthy, corrective deflation.</p>

<p>While Yang claims the printing of $4 trillion for bailouts caused &ldquo;no inflation&rdquo; the housing and asset market is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=dGy">calling BS</a> in unprecedented and truly frightening fashion. If a house was worth $200,000 five years ago, and now is worth $300,000, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the house changed, or that the property became legitimately more valuable. What it often means is that the dollar became significantly weaker against the asset. As these asset prices are thus inflated, banks are able to give out bigger and bigger loans against the asset collateral. Once the jig is up, the bubble bursts and the tumble down is severe, with collateral value no longer covering loans. The graph above shows just how dramatically this buildup is happening currently, with asset inflation signaled by U.S. household net worth against GDP at an all-time-high since 1952 of 535%.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Stolen Generosity</h2>
<p>Not only is Yang&rsquo;s proposition economically unsound, it&rsquo;s also morally objectionable. This is a hard pill to swallow for many hopeful millennials and Yang gang supporters of all ages, tired of scraping by and struggling in the current corrupt, Keynesian paradigm. That notwithstanding, Yang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Forward&rdquo; is no different from the vague and vapid &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; Change,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a better man&rdquo; of previous candidates.</p>
<p>To pay the Freedom Dividend, Yang proposes you be robbed. Business owners not wishing to apply his suggested VAT would be punished for refusal. Consumers not wishing to pay it, as well. It&rsquo;s an unpleasant reality, but there&rsquo;s no way to put it more accurately. Yang <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many are unsure of what Andrew Yang&rsquo;s fair share of their income should be. If I similarly were forced to pay every neighbor I have a portion of my paycheck because 15 or 20 of them said I must, or be put in a cage, people would be understandably scandalized by the sociopathic suggestion. But if the theft is euphemized as a &ldquo;Freedom Dividend&rdquo; it&rsquo;s suddenly made much more palatable to the masses. While some maintain taxation is a necessary evil for preserving civilization, this position is illogical. There&rsquo;s nothing civil about stealing from anyone under threat of violence, and a social need doesn&rsquo;t justify criminal activity, anyway. If it did, the folks in the U.S. during the plantation slavery era would have been correct in their protests against abolition: &ldquo;But who will pick the cotton!?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin&rsquo;s Fix</h2>
<p>Leaving Andrew Yang&rsquo;s universe for a moment, it seems important to address crypto as a potential solution for the current political corruption he supposedly stands against. A recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/10/29/facebooks-cryptocurrency-wont-help-poor-access-banks-heres-what-would/">opinion piece</a> in the Washington Post proclaims: &ldquo;Facebook&rsquo;s cryptocurrency won&rsquo;t help the poor access banks. Here&rsquo;s what would.&rdquo; The piece goes on to detail the impossibility of Facebook&rsquo;s upcoming Libra cryptocurrency actually helping the unbanked of the world, due to government regulations. The article un-ironically closes by suggesting that the very same overbearing government is the solution, stating: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that financial inclusion would help millions of Americans and benefit the economy. But it can be achieved through time-tested and democratic institutions. In fact, the United States already has a public payments system: the Federal Reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What so few in the space seem to realize about crypto is that the potential for banking the unbanked, pulling people out of poverty, and enabling savings and the building of wealth for the average individual is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/food-shelter-and-clothing-bitcoin-cash-charities-making-a-global-impact/">already here</a>. The state stands in the way with endless surveillance, KYC/AML requirements, taxes and capital controls, so it happens in the <a href="http://local.bitcoin.com">regulatory cracks</a>, at present.</p>
<p>Instead of a $1,000 monthly paycheck in trash money, why not drop all restrictions on trade and allow people to grow their wealth and businesses independently? If we&rsquo;re worried that criminal warlords and kingpins would take over, just look around &mdash; they <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/flowery-v20-talk-and-government-terror-why-darknet-crime-is-the-least-of-our-worries/">already have</a>. It is precisely because of the illogical centralization of power and lack of a logical, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-voluntaryism-where-libertarian-philosophy-meets-crypto/">level playing field</a> that a candidate like Yang can gain any prominence at all. In a free society &mdash; and no offense here to Yang personally &mdash; he&rsquo;d likely be known as just a common con artist.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Distributing Digital Asset Seeds Using Vault12 and Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing</h2>
<p>Vault12 believes there&rsquo;s a dire need to safeguard crypto assets as the onset of blockchain-powered innovation continues to grow exponentially. Since the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-bitcoins-peer-to-peer-cash-system-was-revealed-11-years-ago/">birth of Bitcoin</a> and a slew of other digital currencies, various applications and devices like hardware wallets have been created to protect cryptos. Vault12&rsquo;s new product allows individuals to take advantage of trusted family members and friends who are willing to help them secure digital currencies. Moreover, guardians are rewarded with ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) to protect the assets as well, giving the trusted network of friends incentive to be a safe keeper. The project officially launched at the San Francisco Blockchain Week and the company is backed by investors like Naval Ravikant, True Ventures, Data Collective, and Winklevoss Capital.</p>

<p>The Vault12 <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/vault12/Vault12+Platform+White+Paper.pdf">white paper</a> explains when it comes to precious digital assets, there is an &ldquo;unprecedented threat level&rdquo; looming for people in need of a strong security solution. &ldquo;To protect these assets, we need a new cryptographic security platform &ndash; one that does not leave security centralized in a single place, with a single person, on a single device or in a single organization,&rdquo; the research paper details. In order to bolster the security of digital currencies even more, the firm created a decentralized storage system for digital assets via a hierarchical Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing (SSS) system. The SSS infrastructure is a well known algorithm in cryptography designed by the cryptographer and mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir">Adi Shamir</a>. Essentially the secret (passkey) is shared in the distributed Vault12 system between 3-5 trusted contacts giving each participant its own unique part.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Vault12 Hopes to Fill the Gap Between the Digital Currency Economy and Unresolved Security Challenges</h2>
<p>Vault12 allows any owner to set up a vault with friends and family. Custodians can always be recruited from the owner&rsquo;s personal network at any time. But high-net-worth individuals who need added security can opt for a professional custodian service (PCS). However, the registration for this service requires far more effort and additional safeguards like verifying the owners&rsquo; identity with a government-issued ID. &ldquo;One of the unresolved challenges for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and the blockchain economy is the continued challenge and burden associated with securing crypto assets,&rdquo; said Max Skibinksy, cofounder and CEO of Vault12. Skibinksy further added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Previously, to keep our digital money safe, we had to keep our extremely valuable cryptographic backups on pieces of paper and store them in traditional banks. It was ironic. We built Vault12 to be an innovative, convenient solution that replaced this cumbersome process.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Vault12 Setup</h2>
<p>Setting up the Vault12 application is a fairly simple process, but you need to decide on 3-5 trusted individuals to help secure your assets. That part of the process may take longer, but setting up the vault after this decision is made doesn&rsquo;t take too long. The app works for Android and iOS devices and when opened, it immediately asks you if you want to set up a vault and then asks permission to access your phone&rsquo;s contacts. The company claims the information is not held on the company&rsquo;s server and you can skip this part and manually add each contact individually as well. After deciding on sharing your contacts with the application, the platform asks you for your name so you can be identified by your guardians helping you protect your vault.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-343894 size-full" title=" Trusted Friends Can Become Crypto Custodians with the Vault12 Platform" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666.jpg" alt=" Trusted Friends Can Become Crypto Custodians with the Vault12 Platform" width="4200" height="2300" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666.jpg 4200w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-300x164.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-768x421.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-1024x561.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-696x381.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-1392x762.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-1068x585.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ggyallen666-767x420.jpg 767w" sizes="(max-width: 4200px) 100vw, 4200px"></p>
<p>The platform then requires you to choose the number of guardians between 3-5 contacts and the more custodians you use, the more secure the vault will be. Once you save the security level (number of guardians), you cannot change it unless you start a whole new vault. If you opted to manually add contacts, you can send them an invitation or scan their device if they already have Vault12 installed. To add digital assets to the vault you simply upload a picture of the seed phrase or use a file containing the seed. The application will inform you of how many people are guarding the seed held within the Vault12 system.</p>

<p>Overall the Vault12 method is an interesting, novel method of safekeeping digital assets but people may have a hard time with a few requirements such as sharing their name, phone number, and contacts. People also may not trust the upload part where the user is required to upload a file or an image that contains a seed phrase protecting digital assets. However, the project&rsquo;s key elements are <a href="https://github.com/vault12">open source</a> and Vault12 users can take a look at the ZAX relay network infrastructure and the distribution of how the shards work. &ldquo;In the future, other elements of the platform will be released as open-source libraries,&rdquo; Vault12&rsquo;s website notes.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Bitcoin Resource Guide for Economics and Social Sciences Teachers in France</h2>
<p>Economics and social sciences teachers from France may opt to teach students about cryptocurrencies in the near future. The <a href="https://www.education.gouv.fr">French Ministry of National Education</a> has issued a <a href="https://cache.media.eduscol.education.fr/file/SES/96/5/RA19_Lycee_G_SPE_SES_1ere_monnaie-ses_1172965.pdf">resource guide</a> that touches on a wide variety of economic subjects. The eight-page guide discusses Bitcoin with a pedagogical activity card that teaches the different functions of money. The &ldquo;educational activity two&rdquo; lessons are comprised of classifying particular examples of money functions specifically with a cryptocurrency. The purpose is for educators to give the example of Bitcoin in order to show students the relationship between traditional money systems and trust as well as other properties. The Ministry of Education also provides resources and proposed activities which include <a href="http://dessinemoileco.com/bitcoin-il-monnaie-les-autres/">four videos</a> hosted by <a href="http://dessinemoileco.com">Dessine-Moi l&rsquo;&eacute;co</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-343813 size-full" title="French Ministry of Education Publishes Bitcoin-Resource Guide for Educators" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource.jpg" alt="French Ministry of Education Publishes Bitcoin-Resource Guide for Educators" width="1500" height="450" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-300x90.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-768x230.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-1024x307.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-696x209.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-1392x418.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-1068x320.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ministrysource-1400x420.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></p>
<p>The videos are called &ldquo;Do you have to trust your currency?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Can Bitcoin replace the euro?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is Bitcoin a currency like any other?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?&rdquo; The teachers&rsquo; resource guide of proposed activities explains that instructors can have students list the functions of currency and show how they apply to Bitcoin. Further, students can separate the euro and cryptocurrencies from a trust point of view. Prior to the Bitcoin section, the resource guide also discusses how central banks mobilize the instruments of monetary policy. According to the Ministry of Education, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/at-least-19-central-banks-give-way-to-monetary-easing-as-economy-slows/">central banks</a> &ldquo;create sufficient money to support global demand, but also ensure the preservation of the purchasing power of the currency.&rdquo; The activity card for French educators says that central banks such as the ECB and Federal Reserve must &ldquo;react&rdquo; if there is a risk of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/more-filthy-fiat-two-dozen-central-banks-ramp-up-the-printing-presses/">accelerated inflation</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Education in High Schools and Universities Continues to Grow</h2>
<p>The four videos about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin on the Dessine-Moi l&rsquo;&eacute;co website are a few years old as they were published in 2017. Despite the age, they are very informative and the transcript from the video &ldquo;Is Bitcoin a currency like any other?&rdquo; explains that Bitcoin is &ldquo;a virtual currency that circulates on the internet.&rdquo; The video also notes that cryptocurrencies allow people to measure the value of goods and services in a digital sense and the network transactions serve as a medium of exchange. The film further says that the cryptocurrency can be stored for future use, but also emphasizes that users should &ldquo;be aware that the euro and bitcoins have different characteristics.&rdquo; &ldquo;The euro is a legal tender, this means that it is recognized by the public authorities and that everyone in the Eurozone is obliged to accept to be paid in euros,&rdquo; the video&rsquo;s transcript reads. &ldquo;Even if more and more e-commerce sites and even some physical shops accept the Bitcoin as a means of payment, nothing obliges a merchant to accept them and no one guarantees that they will be accepted in the future,&rdquo; the video hosted on Dessine-Moi l&rsquo;&eacute;co adds.</p>

<p>Academic institutionsaround the world have embraced spreading blockchain and digital currency knowledge for years now. For instance, the University of Luxembourg provides crypto security courses, Columbia University and IBM offer a slew of educational resources, and the University of Tokyo offers a blockchain innovation course as well. Coinbase recently published findings that disclosed more than <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-42-of-worlds-best-universities-offer-crypto-courses/">40% of the top universities</a> around the world offer a course in cryptocurrency or blockchain. The study also found that 25% of the students surveyed were interested in taking a course on cryptographic technology. A high school in Brisbane, Australia had a lot of interest in Bitcoin so it prompted Brisbane students to create a cryptocurrency information night. Students at Union Catholic High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey were also curious about digital currencies and the school&rsquo;s Business and Personal Finance class <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-is-finding-its-way-into-high-schools/">added</a> a cryptocurrencies course during the second semester in 2018. Last year, news.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dutch-high-school-exam-features-bitcoin-themed-questions/">reported</a> on a Dutch high school exam that featured Bitcoin-themed questions. The French Ministry of Education teaching educators how to address current cryptocurrency trends indicates that academic institutions take the technology very seriously.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitmex Suffers a Day of Reckoning</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s been a rough 24 hours for derivatives exchanges. Shortly before Bitmex CC&rsquo;d in its mailing list, Deribit was forced to reimburse traders who were liquidated due to an error in its price index. Bitmex users are now being urged to change their details, with hackers and phishers certain to try and crack the leaked email addresses, many of which are likely to be tied to accounts on different crypto exchanges. The leaked and then aggregated Bitmex database is now up for sale on the darknet.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deribit will reimburse over $1.3 million in losses from the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> index calculation data issue around 21:00:00 UTC on October 31, 2019.</p>
<p>The Deribit Insurance fund will not be used to cover these losses, but compensation will be covered by Deribit.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exchanges such as Binance have</span><a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1190176334837735425https://twitter.com/binance/status/1190176334837735425"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">already advised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their users to modify email addresses if they were also linked to Bitmex. The blunder is a stark reminder to traders to use a unique email address and password for each platform, utilizing a password manager if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PR disaster was compounded when Bitmex&rsquo;s official Twitter handle was briefly compromised, with</span><a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1190253155122106368"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reading &ldquo;Hacked&rdquo; and &ldquo;Take your <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and run.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a</span><a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/updated-statement-on-the-email-privacy-issue-impacting-our-users/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bitmex cited a software error as the cause of the email breach, and stressed that, beyond email addresses, &ldquo;no other personal data or account information have been disclosed and no further emails have been sent.&rdquo; The statement also urged users to add official Bitmex email addresses to their contact lists and ensure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all their accounts.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#9888;&#65039;We are aware of a large-scale user email leak from another exchange.&#9888;&#65039;</p>
<p>If you are one of the affected users and you also have a Binance account under the same email address, we recommend changing your email immediately using the below steps:<a href="https://t.co/sgEr5sqleg">https://t.co/sgEr5sqleg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1190176334837735425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of Thousands of Addresses Exposed</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitmex deputy COO Vivien Khoo said that while the email was sent to the majority of Bitmex users, not all were affected. According to</span><a href="http://skew.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">skew.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the exchange &ndash; which operates out of Seychelles &ndash; has 22,000 average daily users. Larry Cermak said on</span><a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1190233517784846336"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that &ldquo;30,000 unique emails in total&rdquo; were jeopardized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the leak, Twitter was aflame with panicked users, some enquiring how to delete their Bitmex account and others claiming to have already received crypto spam emails. There was further anger when it emerged that Bitmex requires users to undergo full KYC, including a selfie with their ID and the word &ldquo;Bitmex,&rdquo; in order to change their email address.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well not a good day for <a href="https://twitter.com/BitMEXdotcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BitMEXdotcom</a> <a href="https://t.co/WmZTpRkr3d">pic.twitter.com/WmZTpRkr3d</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email breach does not come at a good time for Bitmex, which is reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over whether it permits U.S. traders to use its platform. Armed with thousands of user email addresses, the CFTC may well step up its investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reputational and regulatory cost of the blunder is still to be counted. In the interim, neglecting to use blind copy on a mass email has given Bitmex and its normally ebullient CEO Arthur Hayes pause for thought.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We would like to reassure our users that while the trolls may target our Twitter account, you may rest assured that all funds are safe.</p>

Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.</i></small></p>
<p>After the devastating news of the removal of offline cash trades and the new vigorous and intrusive KYC policy from popular P2P Exchange Platform (Localbitcoins) the community needed an alternative. We&rsquo;re happy to announce the arrival of GlobalBitcoinsPro.com which has been created to revive the community.</p>
<p>Created by a group of OTC traders that grew from trading on Localbitcoins and noticed a decline in the community they were used to, they simply &ldquo;Wanted to bring back the glory days&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GlobalBitcoinsPro.com is a peer-to-peer (p2p) cryptocurrency exchange platform, it is the newest and most reliable platform allowing users to safely perform both online and offline trades. Their main attraction is the familiar, popular and easy to use interface that many traders already know how to use making it easier to just make an account and start creating ads and trading. They also added new and exciting features that serve two communities by offering the choice of trading between <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> (Bitcoin Core) & <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> (Bitcoin Cash). One of their primary objectives is to facilitate the efficient trade of cryptocurrencies on a global scale, which will ultimately result in a digital community coming together. GlobalBitcoinsPro.com has a very convenient, easy to use functionality making the usage of this platform smooth and hassle-free. This platform is available worldwide with active users in multiple countries. They have also competitively slashed fees in half by charging only half a percent as opposed to the competition that charges 1% fees on all trades.</p>
<p>Filling the gap in the market of p2p cryptocurrency trading platforms</p>
<p>After recognising a gap in the market, when the market leaders took down their offline trading features, they decided to fill that gap by recreating a similar platform with added features allowing users to trade with physical cash once again. A popular platform &lsquo;LocalBitcoins&rsquo; took down offline trades early June resulting in numerous complaints and loyal users having no support. GlobalBitcoinsPro.com swiftly filled this and brought offline trades back therefore allowing users to still have an option for either offline and online trades.</p>
<p>Enabling more access to Crypto Currencies in developing countries where banks cannot reach</p>
<p>GlobalBitcoinsPro.com has worked on bringing the world of Crypto Currencies to every city and they are constantly expanding. This allows the access to Crypto Currencies to stretch globally to developing countries that would usually be ignored by the traditional banking world. This is evidently not only a platform just for trading, but they are also looking to advance the community and introducing Crypto to the world economy.</p>

The former IMF Managing Director implored: &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it true that ultimately we have done the right thing to act in favour of jobs and of growth rather than the protection of savers?&rdquo; Regarding former president Mario Draghi and the ECB&rsquo;s negative interest rate policy, she went on to imply that people should be grateful for the job policies, savings protected or not.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Easy for You to Say, Lagarde</h2>
<p>Some commentators were taken aback by the bold remarks <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes/status/1189582776401616901">reported</a> Wednesday, with one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/rodrigopacini/status/1189900578987630598">remarking</a>: &ldquo;translation: You should be happy to be slaves.&rdquo; Another felt Lagarde&rsquo;s words embodied &ldquo;The old mantra to make the tax slaves think they would be jobless without the government protecting them. Propaganda doesn&rsquo;t work when you&rsquo;re enlightened by Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-343767 size-full" title="ECB President: &rsquo;We Should Be Happier to Have a Job Than to Have Our Savings Protected&rsquo;" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23.jpg" alt="ECB President: &rsquo;We Should Be Happier to Have a Job Than to Have Our Savings Protected&rsquo;" width="403" height="403" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23.jpg 403w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23-150x150.jpg 150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<p>In her address, the new ECB leader chided the German and Dutch governments for not investing their budget surpluses in causes she deems worthy, such as infrastructure, education and innovation to &ldquo;allow for a better rebalancing.&rdquo; As far as the common folk go, the bigwig of financial policy noted in blatantly direct fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should be happier to have a job than to have our savings protected &hellip; I think that it is in this spirit that monetary policy has been decided by my predecessors and I think they made quite a beneficial choice.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who Is &lsquo;We&rsquo;? &ndash; Poverty In the EU</h2>
<p>When Lagarde says &ldquo;we&rdquo; one is inclined to wonder who exactly she is talking about. According to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Europe_2020_indicators_-_poverty_and_social_exclusion#General_overview">statistics</a>, 16.9% of EU residents are living at risk of poverty even after welfare and social transfer factors are accounted for as of 2017. Many Europeans may be currently &ldquo;employed,&rdquo; but the nice sounding stats are often bolstered by extremely lax measures of what constitutes said employment. Spotty and unreliable jobs such as someone working only one hour a week still officially serve to make Draghi and Lagarde&rsquo;s rhetoric appear sound. According to the August, 2018 <a href="https://wol.iza.org/articles/measuring-employment-and-unemployment/long">study</a> &ldquo;Measuring employment and unemployment&rdquo; by Bank of Italy researchers Andrea Brandolini and Eliana Viviano:</p>
<blockquote><p>The employment rate is the proportion of the working-age population with a paid job: it is a headcount measure that disregards how working time and contract duration differ across the employed.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the multimillion-dollar-net-worth Lagarde sips champagne in designer clothes and &ldquo;power scarves,&rdquo; the common plebs living paycheck-to-paycheck governed by ECB policy must remain grateful that although their savings are being eaten alive, at least they can work, maybe. Those taking issue with the new negative rate defender at the ECB are not necessarily opposed to high fashion and the good life, as much as the hypocrisy and arrogance required to utter such nonsense in a position like Lagarde&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Savings Are Essential to Healthy Economies</h2>
<p>As American economist Murray Rothbard once wrote, &ldquo;Savings and investment are indissolubly linked. It is impossible to encourage one and discourage the other.&rdquo; Without the ability to save, there is no ability to invest. No chance to build for a future, or to create space by leveraging finance for personal time for innovation, exploration and rest.</p>
<p>Lagarde&rsquo;s proclamation that those nations with surplus should invest, while calling for everyday individuals to essentially quiet down about retaining value, betrays an important disconnect and telling, underlying worldview: money and savings are for us, working is for you.</p>
<p>Ironic that the socialist lawyer from France would take such a position. Looping back around to Bitcoin, the statements also betray something else. The very reason most governments stand opposed to permissionless, decentralized finance and <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/">cryptocurrencies</a> may be that Bitcoin enables saving and spending freely, regardless of what any disconnected third party might think about what should be done with your money.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Miners Talk Bitcoin Halving 2020</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin.com team has recently talked with ten prominent people from the crypto mining industry about the upcoming halving at the World Digital Mining Summit 2019 in Frankfurt. Some think that it might cause miners&rsquo; revenues to crash, others think prices will quickly rise to compensate for the diminished rewards, all agree it will be a pivotal event for the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TjuzBZnhXJU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The full list of mining experts interviewed in the <a href="https://youtu.be/TjuzBZnhXJU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> includes: Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining; Thomas Heller, F2Pool Global Business Director; Sean M. Walsh, CEO & Chairman of the Board, Hyperblock Inc; Dr. Mervyn G. Maistry, Board Member Cyberian Mine; Carson Blake, CEO of SBI Crypto; Alexander Levin, CEO of Asicseer.com; Eric P. Yingling, an independent miner; Nick Damico, CTO at BitPatagonia; Hugh Tian, Co-founder of Antpool; and &Aring;smund Myhre, CEO of Oslofjord Datacenter.</p>
<p>In terms of the professional mining industry it seems we should expect to see a major concentration of the business as the halving will take place. Those with larger hashing power and access to cheaper sources of energy will squeeze out from the market operations that need higher margins to survive and make a profit. &ldquo;The halving is a brutal wipe-out event,&rdquo; explained Marco Streng. &ldquo;It knocks out immediately the miners who are not efficient enough and shows no mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We might also see fluctuations and changes in global hash power distribution during the few weeks that are expected to pass between the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> halving and the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> halving, as SHA-256 miners will switch to the most profitable chain to mine at the time.</p>
<p>With regards to the effect the halving will have on prices opinions are more split. We could see prices double as miners will need to keep their current revenue streams, or even take off not long after as has happened in the past. &ldquo;If you look at six months before the halving and six month after the halving in both previous instances you see massive upward surge in the price of bitcoin,&rdquo; commented Sean Walsh. &ldquo;It is a bit scary being a miner and knowing that your revenue stream is gonna get cut in half over night but the exchange rate will more than compensate for the reduction in our bitcoin denominated revenue.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">What and When Is the Next Halving?</h2>
<p>Every time a new block is mined, those who facilitated it are rewarded with a set amount of coins. But once every 210,000 blocks this set reward amount is programmed to decrease by half, hence the name halving. This mechanism was created by Satoshi Nakamoto to ensure current supply is limited, making coins more scarce as there will never be more than 21 million in circulation. It can also create upward pressure on the price in contrast to most fiat currencies that only lose value over time due to inflation.</p>
<p>The first ever halving took place in 2012 when the block reward initially set to 50 coins fell to just 25. The second and last halving so far took place in 2016 when the block reward dropped from 25 to just 12.5 coins.</p>
<p>The upcoming bitcoin cash halving event is expected to be during April 2020. After this happens, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) and receive just 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and fees per block mined. The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> halving is expected not far after that in May 2020. A German bank recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/german-bank-predicts-btc-at-90000-after-next-halving/">predicted</a> a tenfold increase in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price when the upcoming block reward halving takes place.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones But Words Make It Less Painful</h2>
<p>In George Orwell&rsquo;s classic dystopian novel 1984, the political language called <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/novels/1984/english/en_app">Newspeak</a> existed &ldquo;not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc [the novel&rsquo;s dystopian political system], but to make all other modes of thought impossible.&rdquo; Politicians today employ the same techniques.</p>
<p>Euphemism is designed to make unpalatable realities sound inoffensive or even pleasant. Economic terms like &ldquo;quantitative easing&rdquo; and &ldquo;NIRP&rdquo; don&rsquo;t sound particularly threatening or bad. The underlying realities successfully obfuscated, however, and central bankers are able to proceed with impunity in economic activity extremely damaging to the finances of the hardworking individuals they govern.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">NIRP and ZIRP</h2>
<p>NIRP and ZIRP are acronyms for &ldquo;negative interest rate policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;zero interest rate policy&rdquo; respectively. The acronyms themselves take some of the punch away from the not-so-wonderful meanings, but the expanded terminologies are also misleading. A negative interest rate is commonly known in the real world as a &ldquo;fee.&rdquo; If interest is a payment one receives for lending money to another person, business, or financial institution, negative interest would be a charge for doing so.</p>
<p>With politicians and global financial advisory groups saying things like &ldquo;Over in Europe and Japan they have NEGATIVE RATES. They get paid to borrow money&rdquo; (<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1189198697059553285">Donald Trump</a>), or &ldquo;Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive&rdquo; (the <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/">IMF</a>), the reality of what is being advocated is hidden.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How Does NIRP Work?</h2>
<p>Negative interest rates are set by a country&rsquo;s central bank. They spur spending and discourage saving. Banks cannot afford to leave excess reserves being eaten away in the central bank at these rates, and are thus incentivized to provide more affordable loans. Some retail banks absorb this cost to keep their depositors from moving savings into cash; other banks <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/major-german-coop-bank-passes-negative-interest-rates-to-customers/">charge their customers</a>. The low rates and increased loans mean that more people borrow and spend, and the now stimulated economy is thus viewed as &ldquo;strong&rdquo; (more newspeak), juiced up on the speed-like drug of increased easy lending. The printing of more money can then justified under this pretext. At some point, however, the chickens of these policies come home to roost, as sound assets and resources are limited, no matter how much paper money a government prints.</p>
<p>ZIRP is the only slightly more conservative cousin of stimulus-addicted NIRP, and is a zero interest rate policy set by a country&rsquo;s central bank. Unlike NIRP, zero is the limit as to how low <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalinterestrate.asp">nominal rates</a> can be set, and so other measures such as quantitative easing are often implemented.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Quantitative Easing</h2>
<p>When zero interest rate policy fails to stimulate an economy adequately, QE, or quantitative easing, may be employed in conjunction. QE is the creation of more money by a central bank, temporarily easing the stress on a given economy. In QE, central banks create more reserves to buy debt and securities from their governments and sometimes even private entities. As finance website thebalance.com <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-quantitative-easing-definition-and-explanation-3305881">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>No funds change hands but the central bank issues a credit to the banks&rsquo; reserves as it buys the securities. QE has the same effect as increasing the money supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the domestic money supply increased, economic activity is expected to be stimulated. Like the NIRP and ZIRP policies detailed above, however, it&rsquo;s akin to taking an aspirin for a serious disease, or buying more credit cards to pay off the pile of old, already maxed-out plastic in one&rsquo;s wallet.</p>

<p>An increased money supply means higher inflation and the resultant loss of purchasing power. In case QE fails to provide a shot in the arm to a given economy, a phenomenon known as stagflation can also occur where inflation continues in the absence of economic growth. It may seem surprising to consider many world leaders, central banks and financial planners are now praising and implementing policies designed to make money weaker in the name of progress, but that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The NIRP Zeitgeist</h2>
<p>In its Global Banking Annual Review 2019, management consulting firm McKinsey & Company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mckinsey-majority-of-banks-may-not-be-economically-viable/">claimed</a> that &ldquo;60 percent of banks destroy value&rdquo; as they are not economically viable. From 2009 to 2018, most banks studied showed a return on equity (ROE) less than their cost of equity (COE). In other words, they are not making ends meet and in the case of another crisis like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">global downturn</a> sparked in the late 2000s, may not survive.</p>
<p>Global trends toward negative rates and easing are nevertheless touted by policy makers as necessary. According to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-research-considers-negative-interest-rates-effective-policy-tool/">research</a> by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, &ldquo;Central banks that have yet to introduce negative rates may take some comfort from this evidence as there appears to be room below zero for additional economic stimulus.&rdquo; The media is complicit in being the megaphone for these concepts of endless easing and low rates as well, with even respected financial publications <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/normalizing-negative-interest-its-flabbergasting-how-closely-media-parrots-the-government/">praising</a> such moves. None of the pretty language, of course, changes the stark reality underneath.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rearranging Deck Chairs on the Titanic</h2>
<p>To see where all this is potentially heading, one only needs to look back at the long list of countries where inflation has already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/3-major-signs-that-precede-the-fall-of-world-reserve-currencies/">spiraled out of control</a>, and the current talk from global monetary policymakers and central banks. While many countries have suffered independently before, the timing now suggests a broader, more global financial meltdown could be on the horizon.</p>
<p>Leadership at the European Central Bank continue to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mario-draghi-leaves-european-central-bank-without-ever-raising-interest-rates/">praise</a> and advocate for the extension of NIRP and ZIRP policy. Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark don&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;ll be escaping their deepening, respective NIRP sloughs anytime soon. The U.S., Australia and New Zealand&rsquo;s rates are all rapidly approaching zero, and New Zealand&rsquo;s central bank is even considering <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/114923477/why-reserve-bank-governor-adrian-orr-prefers-negative-interest-rates-to-qe">taxing cash</a> to force people to spend and discourage saving.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/">maintained</a> in February 2019:</p>
<blockquote><p>Severe recessions have historically required 3&ndash;6 percentage points cut in policy rates. If another crisis happens, few countries would have that kind of room for monetary policy to respond.</p></blockquote>
<p>As rates are already so low globally, another recession could spell real disaster. One of the IMF&rsquo;s proposed solutions was to even eliminate cash, another emergent global theme.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, central bankers appear to be playing a board game. When the colorful strips of play money run out, the banker just writes some numbers on blank pieces paper and the game goes on. In Monopoly, this is all for the sake of fun and leisure. In reality, it&rsquo;s a game being played with people&rsquo;s very livelihoods, by saccharine-tongued politicians and central bank governors who have nothing to lose by gambling your money away.</p>
