Some of its features, however, like the characteristic irreversibility of blockchain transactions, have created certain challenges for the traditional legal and financial systems. At times they may seem incompatible with cryptocurrencies, but that&rsquo;s not always the case. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Legacy Legal Systems Facing Distributed Ledgers</h2>
<p>Matthias Lehmann, director of the Institute for International Private and Comparative Law at the University of Bonn, explores some of the challenges decentralized digital currencies pose to the current legal systems and proposes solutions in a recently published <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2019/10/who-owns-bitcoin-private-international-law-facing-blockchain">article</a>. But Instead of focusing on transfers resulting from fraud, like the media often does, the German professor turns attention to &ldquo;less reported&rdquo; but equally possible transactions.</p>
<p>Lehmann highlights two groups of problems &ndash; &lsquo;endogenous,&rsquo; associated with faulty transfers where the sender commits a mistake or lacks legal capacity to make the transfer, and &lsquo;exogenous&rsquo; problems, when a need for correction may arise because of events taking place outside of the blockchain. The latter category includes insolvency proceedings, for example, or succession of crypto assets. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) was designed to prohibit double spending, but it cannot reverse faulty transfers and does not allow for a transfer of title outside the blockchain, the scholar notes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340785 size-full" title="Traditional Law and Finance Can Adapt to Bitcoin, These Examples Show" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1512098330.jpg" alt="Traditional Law and Finance Can Adapt to Bitcoin, These Examples Show" width="1000" height="508" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1512098330.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1512098330-300x152.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1512098330-768x390.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1512098330-696x354.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1512098330-827x420.jpg 827w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>These are common problems and they are pretty standard in private law, the legal expert remarks. But imposing the ordinary rules of private law is not an option in the case of <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">cryptocurrencies</a>. That&rsquo;s because of the irreversibility of blockchain transactions, on the one hand, and the difficulties in establishing the governing law, on the other. Instead of advocating the easy way out by rejecting what doesn&rsquo;t fit into existing presumptions, Professor Lehmann suggests a workaround.</p>
<p>To fulfil its corrective function under such circumstances, private law may resort to implementing the concept of &lsquo;obligation to make a transfer.&rsquo; The author further elaborates: &ldquo;For instance, a person who has received a certain amount of Bitcoin by error could be obliged to send back the same amount. A transfer obligation may also be the remedy of choice to effectuate the rights of an insolvency administrator or the heir of an estate.&rdquo; Other existing laws can be applied to permissionless networks too, like the law of torts in the case of a coerced transfer and the law of restitution to return crypto assets sent by mistake.</p>
<p>Matthias Lehmann thinks the validity of a blockchain transfer should not be assessed using the ordinary concepts of property law and insists that when a correction is needed, transfer obligations will do the job. Thus an &ldquo;overly assertive role of the law that would make the DLT inefficient and ultimately unviable&rdquo; can be avoided. The proposed solution corrects the results of a transaction &ldquo;only to the extent necessary, using the forms and procedures of the DLT&rdquo; and &ldquo;dispenses with the need for identifying one national law governing the blockchain by distributing the applicable rules among the various affected legal systems.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Daily Fixing Formula Proposed for Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Decentralized digital currencies are also criticized by the establishment for their volatility which, according to the apologists of the fiat system, makes them inappropriate for a number of applications that require a stable unit of account. The rapid and sometimes significant change in market prices makes it hard to accurately gauge the value of items priced in cryptocurrency, they claim for instance, despite the existence of <a href="https://giftcards.bitcoin.com/giftcards">products</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/these-debit-cards-will-help-you-spend-your-bch-anywhere/">services</a> that already bridge the gap between young, free <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">crypto markets</a> and traditional markets dominated by centrally managed fiat systems.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of the crypto space that distinguishes it from the traditional financial world is that bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t have a fixed exchange rate against other currencies such as those determined by central banks for fiat currencies. However, a reference figure like that is sometimes needed, for example, in court cases involving financial relations or when estimating someone&rsquo;s tax obligations for holdings in a currency different from the national fiat.</p>
<p>The Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain and the Russian Bar Association have recently proposed a solution. The two organizations came up with a formula to set an &lsquo;official,&rsquo; so to speak, exchange rate for a particular cryptocurrency. Price data acquired from several digital asset exchanges every 30 seconds will be used to calculate a daily weighted average and the result will be published once every 24 hours. Taking that value as a benchmark, reference exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble can also be determined and used in accounting.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">While Holding Foundational Support, Crypto Markets Face a Fork in the Road</h2>
<p>On October 20, digital currency markets are meandering at levels not seen since spring and many traders are uncertain where the road will lead. The market cap of all 2,000+ cryptocurrencies is hovering around $220 billion and global trade volume is about $50 billion. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has wavered between $7,900-8,090 in the last 24 hours and prices are down 4.7% for the week. The overall <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> market valuation is $144 billion out of the $220 billion, representing 66% dominance over other coins.</p>

<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) is down 5.4% this Sunday and each <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is swapping for $173. Behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is ripple (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>) as each coin is trading for $0.29 but prices are up 4% over the last seven days.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) Market Action</h2>
<p>The fifth largest market capitalization is held by bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) with a total valuation of around $3.8 billion at press time. Each <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> is swapping for $215 per coin at the moment and there&rsquo;s a touch over a billion in global trade volume today. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> is down 0.44% this Sunday, and over the last seven days the asset has lost 4.7%. Additionally, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> is currently the seventh most traded coin below <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a> and above <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>. Tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) is the top pair traded with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, capturing 55% of the day&rsquo;s trades and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has around 20% of trades.</p>

<p>This is followed by <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> (11.6%), USD (10%), and KRW (1%). During the last few weeks, honestcoin (USDH) has entered the top 10 pairs with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and currently sits in seventh position. The dumps taking place across the broader crypto markets have caused <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> to slide in value but its has steered clear of a key support level between $195-205.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Whale Movements and Rekt Long Positions</h2>
<p>Traders have seen some significant price movements since the end of September and during this time large holders have been moving massive sums of cryptocurrencies. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert">Whale Alert</a>, a Twitter bot that tracks coins like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>, millions of dollars (occasionally a billion) in single transactions have been moved by whales.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTCUSD&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTCUSD</a> Quarterly futures has liquidated a long position of 652 contract at 7,932.74 &ndash; 2019-10-20 05:18:59</p>
<p>&mdash; WhaleCalls (@whalecalls) <a href="https://twitter.com/whalecalls/status/1185666682284642304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On October 17, a transaction for 9,999 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was seen and millions of tethers are moving between huge wallets and the top exchanges on a <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1185821193196183552">regular basis</a>. In addition to the enormous movements, another tracker called Whalecalls shows that a bunch of traders playing long positions on Okcoin are being liquidated routinely. Similar action can be seen on leveraged markets on Bitfinex and Bitmex as well.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Futures Markets Might Be Smacking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Prices Around</h2>
<p>People have been obsessed for quite some time trying to figure out why <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices move a certain way. The last two weeks of bearish action have been odd to some traders but other speculators believe the volatility is stemming from futures markets. When Bakkt first launched and the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dropped significantly on September 24, the senior market analyst at Etoro, Mati Greenspan, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-price-drop-bakkt-51569365796">said</a>: &ldquo;The catalyst for today&rsquo;s plunge, in my mind, seems to be the underwhelming launch of Bakkt. [This is a prime example] of buy the rumor, sell the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340853" title="Market Outlook: Cryptocurrencies Hold Steady But Face a Crucial Turning Point " src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/960x0.jpg" alt="Market Outlook: Cryptocurrencies Hold Steady But Face a Crucial Turning Point " width="483" height="319" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/960x0.jpg 960w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/960x0-300x198.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/960x0-768x506.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/960x0-696x459.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/960x0-637x420.jpg 637w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin&rsquo;s recent price drop is a result of technical and fundamental factors, including a breakdown of the consolidation range, Bakkt&rsquo;s tame launch of futures, and a sudden network hash rate drop,&rdquo; explained Joe DiPasquale, CEO of Bitbull Capital, after the initial price drop. On October 13, Zak Selbert, chief executive of Indexica, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/10/13/is-this-the-real-reason-behind-bitcoins-latest-sell-off/#7c44bfea701c">explained</a> that the action is due to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&rsquo;s maturity in traditional capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that bitcoin is a big kid, anything can make it move, just like anything can make gold or a G-10 currency move,&rdquo; Selbert said. &ldquo;Bitcoin is part of the financial landscape in a very intertwined and mature way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fear and Head-Fakes</h2>
<p>During the last two weeks or longer, the general sentiment throughout the cryptoconomy has been quite bearish. At the time of writing, the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI)</a> indicates that investors are showing a level of &ldquo;fear.&rdquo; However, in August the CFGI score was an 11, which pointed to &ldquo;extreme fear&rdquo; in regard to the crypto community&rsquo;s emotions and sentiments. Today&rsquo;s data stands at 37, which is far better than the summer.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good potential for a Head Fake in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTCUSD&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTCUSD</a>. Wait for it. <a href="https://t.co/JR0rYZdUfS">https://t.co/JR0rYZdUfS</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Bollinger (@bbands) <a href="https://twitter.com/bbands/status/1184500141606109184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The CFGI index dropped to a low of 24 on September 27, indicating that even though market trends have been dreary, the general sentiment is improving. While watching <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD movements on October 17, technical analyst John Bollinger stated that there was a possibility of a &ldquo;head-fake.&rdquo; Essentially, a head-fake is when an asset&rsquo;s price makes a swing in the reverse direction out of nowhere but traditionally when prices touch support foundations.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">All Eyes Are Watching Crypto Charts, Indicators and Any Signs of Forecast Signals</h2>
<p>At the time of publication, most digital asset prices are wandering aimlessly just above the support levels held months ago. Traders have their eyes peeled while closely watching moving averages, liquidity, global trade volumes, and major support or resistance levels. It&rsquo;s safe to say that even the most prescient analysts do not know which way crypto markets will swing from here. However, veteran traders understand very well that market prices are at a pivotal position and face a fork in the road.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Effects of No-Deal Brexit on Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>On Saturday, the British parliament voted to put off a decision on Prime Minister Boris Johnson&rsquo;s deal, forcing him to ask the EU for another Brexit delay. William Thomas, CEO of peer-to-peer exchange Cryptomate, explained to news.Bitcoin.com that many people are calling this deal &ldquo;&lsquo;Brexit in name only&rsquo; as it still ties us in with many EU institutions, including future regulatory alignment,&rdquo; adding that a no-deal Brexit is becoming even more of a possibility.</p>
<figure id="attachment_340771" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-340771" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-340771 size-full" title="'No-Deal Brexit Huge Positive for UK Cryptocurrency' - How Brexit Could Affect the Industry" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson.png" alt="'No-Deal Brexit Huge Positive for UK Cryptocurrency' - How Brexit Could Affect the Industry" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson.png 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson-300x150.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson-768x384.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson-696x348.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson-840x420.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-340771" class="wp-caption-text">Boris Johnson trying to convince Parliament of his Brexit deal.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the event of no-deal being reached by Oct. 31, Thomas said, &ldquo;there will be substantial uncertainty within British and EU financial institutions.&rdquo; However, in terms of whether it will create demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, &ldquo;I am not so certain,&rdquo; he admitted, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would expect to see some upward movement on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/GBP markets shortly after the deadline, but since the British pound is a small portion of global crypto volume it may not have a large overall effect on price as some have predicted.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It will, however, have a positive impact within the British market, but the degree of which this will affect the global cryptocurrency markets is speculative at this time,&rdquo; he opined.</p>
<p>Cryptomate allows British users to purchase a wide range of cryptocurrencies via instant bank transfer. The platform claims to have served 11,250 customers, filled 44,853 orders worth approximately 14.43 million British pounds (~$18.74 million).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How the UK Crypto Industry Could Be Affected</h2>
<p>Thomas further explained to news.Bitcoin.com how the U.K. cryptocurrency industry will likely be affected in the event of a no-deal Brexit. &ldquo;For larger traditional financial service industries that operate out of London, there are safeguards that will see financial services &lsquo;passporting&rsquo; to the EU market will continue until future agreements are made,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-340772 aligncenter" title="'No-Deal Brexit Huge Positive for UK Cryptocurrency' - How Brexit Could Affect the Industry" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fca.png" alt="'No-Deal Brexit Huge Positive for UK Cryptocurrency' - How Brexit Could Affect the Industry" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fca.png 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fca-300x150.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fca-768x384.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fca-696x348.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fca-840x420.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>However, there is nothing in place and very little guidance from the British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) about how this should affect the crypto industry and related services. &ldquo;There is a huge lack of clarity in the area,&rdquo; he emphasized. Nonetheless, he shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s my personal belief that a no-deal Brexit would be a huge positive for the U.K. cryptocurrency industry in the long term, as it enables us to create our own regulatory systems without interference from the EU &ndash; who are much less friendly to the industry as a whole compared to the U.K.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Other Expectations</h2>
<p>For European Union customers who use British-based exchange/wallet services and vise-versa, Thomas said that a no-deal Brexit &ldquo;will have very little impact&rdquo; on them. &ldquo;British and EU customers will still be able to use SEPA bank payments which account for most exchange deposits within Europe, so trading volume should remain unchanged,&rdquo; the CEO continued, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Britain will continue regulatory alignment with the EU the day after we leave (until December 2020) so there&rsquo;s no reason to think there will be any major disruption to banking or money services on November 1st.</p></blockquote>

<p>As for Cryptomate, Thomas confirmed: &ldquo;We will continue to accept European Union customers who have access to UK banking and this policy will not change unless we&rsquo;re told differently by the FCA.&rdquo; He added that most sellers on his platform have indicated that they &ldquo;will be keeping their trading funds in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, as opposed to GBP or EUR,&rdquo; noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would expect to see demand for bitcoin and others increase during November, as a no-deal is likely to see the pound weaken further against the euro (and the euro vs the dollar) as people look for safe havens outside of fiat.</p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fed Studies Negative Rates as Important Policy Tool</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco published a research paper last week exploring the effects of central banks introducing negative interest rates. The paper, entitled &ldquo;Yield Curve Responses to Introducing Negative Policy Rates,&rdquo; is authored by Jens H.E. Christensen, a research advisor in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. This department conducts research on a wide range of topics in support of the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s policy and public outreach functions.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-340690 aligncenter" title="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fed-san-francisco.png" alt="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fed-san-francisco.png 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fed-san-francisco-300x150.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fed-san-francisco-768x384.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fed-san-francisco-696x348.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fed-san-francisco-840x420.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the low level of interest rates in many developed economies, negative interest rates could become an important policy tool for fighting future economic downturns,&rdquo; the author proposed, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>With short- and medium-term interest rates near historical lows in many developed countries, central banks&rsquo; latitude to provide adequate monetary stimulus during a future economic downturn has been severely curtailed.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examining 5 Central Banks With Negative Rates</h2>
<p>Christensen examined five central banks that have already introduced negative interest rates: the Danish National Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Swiss National Bank, the Swedish Riksbank, and the Bank of Japan. The Danish National Bank introduced a negative rate in July 2012.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-340697 aligncenter" title="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates.png" alt="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" width="2527" height="1282" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates.png 2527w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-300x152.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-768x390.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-1024x519.png 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-696x353.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-1392x706.png 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-1068x542.png 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/negative-rates-828x420.png 828w" sizes="(max-width: 2527px) 100vw, 2527px"></p>
<p>He explained that one way to measure the effects of negative interest rates &ldquo;is through the financial market reaction as reflected in the change of the government bond yield curve when negative policy rates are introduced for the first time.&rdquo; He clarified that government bond yields were chosen for the study because &ldquo;they represent a common and widely used benchmark that is available in all five cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to his research, &ldquo;The large level decline in the entire yield curve in all five cases reveals that the zero lower bound is a constraint only in theory and not in practice,&rdquo; Christensen claims. &ldquo;These results demonstrate that negative rates are effective in lowering yields of all maturities; they thereby help ease financial conditions in much the same way that lowering the policy rate works away from the zero lower bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-340756 aligncenter" title="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields.jpg" alt="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" width="3223" height="1205" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields.jpg 3223w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-300x112.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-768x287.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-1024x383.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-696x260.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-1392x520.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-1068x399.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond-yields-1123x420.jpg 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 3223px) 100vw, 3223px"></p>
<p>Christensen further asserted that &ldquo;More importantly, though, subsequent developments have shown that short- and medium-term yields are able to assume values significantly below zero for a prolonged period,&rdquo; referencing the two-year government bond yields chart shown below. &ldquo;Also, the notable variation in negative medium-term yields implies that there is no obvious effective lower bound beyond the empirical fact that it is clearly located significantly below zero,&rdquo; he further claims.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340749" title="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields.jpg" alt="Fed Research Considers Negative Interest Rates Effective Policy Tool" width="500" height="351" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields.jpg 1713w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-300x211.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-768x539.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-100x70.jpg 100w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-200x140.jpg 200w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-696x489.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-1392x978.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-1068x750.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-year-bond-yields-598x420.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Reiterating that &ldquo;the entire yield curve for government bonds in those economies tends to shift lower,&rdquo; Christensen believes, &ldquo;This suggests that negative rates may be an effective monetary policy tool to help ease financial conditions.&rdquo; In addition, with &ldquo;the ultimate effective lower bound for short-term nominal interest rates are significantly below zero, at least for the five economies considered here,&rdquo; the Fed researcher concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Central banks that have yet to introduce negative rates may take some comfort from this evidence as there appears to be room below zero for additional economic stimulus.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">ECB Rate Cuts Affecting Banks</h2>
<p>The European Central Bank&rsquo;s key interest rate turned negative in 2014. Last month, the ECB cut its key rate to a record low of -0.5% from -0.4%. The negative rate policy is forcing European banks to pass on the burden to their customers, such as in the case of major German coop bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/major-german-coop-bank-passes-negative-interest-rates-to-customers/">Berliner Volksbank</a>. The bank started applying a -0.5% rate on deposits exceeding 100,000 euros (~$110,000) this month.</p>

<p>A number of European central bankers have voiced their concerns over further ECB rate cuts. Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco, for example, said at a conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings on Thursday: &ldquo;Banks may shrink their loan supply. That is the reason why we are on one side concerned.&rdquo; He was further quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think we have to be very careful of the possible negative effects of negative rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oswald Gruebel, a former Credit Suisse CEO and an ex-executive of UBS Group AG, remarked in a recent interview: &ldquo;Negative interest rates are crazy. That means money is not worth anything any more &hellip; As long as we have negative interest rates, the financial industry will continue to shrink.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why Face to Face?</h2>
<p>For anyone that&rsquo;s ever had their money frozen on an exchange, this question is a no-brainer. Since most exchange wallets are custodial, meaning the service itself holds and manages user funds centrally, one bug in the code, hack, or audit from a governmental regulatory agency could mean that you and your money are parted indefinitely. Stomach sinkers of this nature have occurred often enough that many, understandably, don&rsquo;t want to run these risks anymore. Others are concerned about privacy and the security of their personal data and information. Trading in person via a non-custodial platform or otherwise lets traders hold funds until the very last second, and guarantees more control. Still, there are important things to be mindful of in order to trade safely and successfully.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Best Practices</h2>
<p>To avoid getting scammed, set up, or potentially endangered, there are some time-tested best practices for trading face to face. The overarching one is simple, though: just use common sense.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a trustworthy platform / trader</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you know someone in your community who also uses cryptocurrencies. Perhaps a friend of a friend, or an acquaintance interested in getting into crypto, but they don&rsquo;t know how. Online, reliable peer-to-peer platforms such as that currently offered at <a href="http://local.bitcoin.com">local.bitcoin.com</a> are great places to start. Platforms that offer <a href="https://local.bitcoin.com/faq#how-does-the-escrow-script-work">blind escrow</a>, and end-to-end chat encryption are the safest bets. Whatever one&rsquo;s approach, testing first and vetting for reliability is critical.</p>
<p>Using shoddy, unproven platforms or trading with strangers who&rsquo;ve no reputation for being honest probably won&rsquo;t end well. There are scammers as well as government agents on some p2p networks, and in real life, more than happy to <a href="https://time.com/5161663/bitcoin-sting-jason-klein-crypto-irs-money-transmitter/">ensnare</a> even innocent, legal users of crypto for their own benefit.</p>
<p>Well-managed platforms will have a reputation system in place so users can verify which traders have completed the most trades successfully, and feedback features for rating their quality of service. Be sure to work out all the specifics of the trading process and procedure in clear detail on an encrypted chat application prior to meeting for the trade.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340720 size-full" title="How to Trade Crypto in Person Safely" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110.jpg" alt="How to Trade Crypto in Person Safely" width="1200" height="627" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110.jpg 1200w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110-300x157.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110-768x401.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110-696x364.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110-1068x558.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1013813110-804x420.jpg 804w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p><strong>Meet in an open, highly visible public space</strong></p>
<p>After working out the specifics of your deal, and providing only necessary information to the contact, meet in an open, highly visible space that is frequented by people but also provides enough serenity to conduct business. A well-lit coffee shop or popular meeting spot in view of the public can be a great place to conduct crypto trades. Trust your gut in meeting someone for the first time, and if anything &ldquo;feels off,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t hesitate to politely back out.</p>

<p><strong>Show me the money, discreetly</strong></p>
<p>A great way to get scammed face to face is to send your bitcoins to the guy across the table and watch him run off without paying you. In this situation you could give chase (risky), yell, flail about, or call the cops, but you&rsquo;re more than likely just SOL. Be sure the other person lets you see the money, gift cards, etc., first, before sending any coins.</p>
<p>Most respectable traders will place money on the table discreetly (in an envelope or book) so that it is within reach of both parties, and sudden moves to bolt are not likely to succeed. Once the tx has enough confirmations for the buyer&rsquo;s liking, they should slide the money over and invite the other party to count it. If you are the one buying crypto be sure to make the seller feel at ease by setting up the trade similarly. Crypto-to-crypto deals require a bit more creativity perhaps, but having both devices in reach and openly in view can help.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Horse Sense Is Number One</h2>
<p>There are limitless options for working out trustworthy trade arrangements, including step-by-step, fractional trades to test the waters on first meeting, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secure_Trading">PGP contracts</a> making it difficult for a party to lie about the agreement after the fact, and verification via other contacts of a trader&rsquo;s reputation. However, as mentioned earlier, the main thing is to trust your reason, and gut instinct. If some aspect of a crypto trade arrangement feels spooky or inconsistent, it&rsquo;s more than okay to kick the deal and get out. More often than not, however, in person trades are fun, friendly experiences that can be a good way to get out of the typically isolated, smugly self-referential hell that is crypto Twitter, catching a breath of fresh air while stacking sats and building the bitcoin economy.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Cash Adoption and Announcements</h2>
<p>The last few weeks have seen a variety of new adoption stories, software development, and new platforms that utilize <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>. Proponents of the decentralized cryptocurrency have been relentlessly pushing for mass adoption while showing a strong dedication toward scaling. Right now the price of bitcoin cash is hovering between $210-230 after most digital assets dropped a few percentages in value last week.</p>

Additionally, at the time of publication it is currently 3.5% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> fans have also witnessed the 18 millionth coin mined on the chain and there&rsquo;s now only three million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> left to mine. The fact that there are so few left makes bitcoin cash scarce and far superior to the fiat currencies that can be printed on a whim.</p>
<h3>Bitcoincash.org&rsquo;s Developer Portal</h3>
<p>On October 10, the website <a href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/">bitcoincash.org</a> announced it is launching a <a href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/developers.html">developer portal</a> so programmers can utilize tools to develop and build on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>. &ldquo;Create amazing apps with Bitcoin Cash with resources for developers, by developers,&rdquo; the website explains.

The reputation system should mitigate a good portion of the risk of cheaters if done right.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Upcoming Consensus Changes and the Road Forward</h2>
<p>Overall there&rsquo;s been a lot happening within the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> ecosystem and passionate Bitcoin Cash proponents continue to truck forward.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Circle Spins Out Poloniex</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circle, which specializes in digital assets and over-the-counter swaps, has decided to sell the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. The terms of the deal are unknown, but Circle paid roughly $400 million for the trading platform in February 2018. In a message to the public, Circle cofounders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire disclosed that the exchange will be its own entity known as Polo Digital Assets, Ltd., and it is now backed by an investment agency located in Asia. Circle&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://blog.circle.com/2019/10/18/poloniex-to-spin-out-of-circle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disclosed that Poloniex will be performing &ldquo;aggressive hiring&rdquo; and the new entity will spend $100 million on operations management.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This transition will mean some significant changes for existing U.S. customers of Poloniex,&rdquo; Circle&rsquo;s blog post underlines. &ldquo;As detailed in a separate announcement from the Poloniex team, U.S. customers will no longer be able to trade on the exchange starting on November 1, 2019.&rdquo; Neville and Allaire&rsquo;s announcement further details: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>U.S. customers will continue to be able to access and use their wallets and withdraw funds through wallet and custody services operated by Circle until at least December 15, 2019.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">US Regulations Stifle Digital Currency Businesses</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cofounders mentioned that it was &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo; for the company to release the firm, but also highlighted that Circle &ldquo;faced challenges as a U.S. company growing a competitive international exchange.&rdquo; On social media and forums, U.S. residents were flabbergasted by Circle&rsquo;s announcement. One person wrote that he was &ldquo;getting really sick of losing access to crypto markets due to being a U.S. citizen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Someone needs to put up an easy how-to guide on how to set up an offshore corporation U.S. citizens can put their assets into, and then how to use a VPN to access exchanges,&rdquo; the individual </span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/djqio1/poloniex_spinning_off_from_circle_as_new_business/f47ep3o/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Reddit forum r/cryptocurrency. </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the cryptocurrency community discussed the Asian investment group that allegedly purchased Poloniex.

<blockquote><p><b><i>One major step backward for crypto in the USA.</i></b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. residents have been at a loss when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges that offer a large assortment of digital currencies. Recently Binance shut down operations in the U.S. for a while and when it returned, the number of tradeable coins was far less. Bitfinex </span><a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/216"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would &ldquo;be discontinuing services to our existing U.S. individual customers&rdquo; in 2017. Last summer Bittrex </span><a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028996652"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned 32 cryptocurrencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from American citizens including QTUM, STORJ, and BCTP. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Poloniex is moving out of the US to focus on international markets.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t even let US customers use their products moving forward.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2017, interest in cryptocurrencies has surged and many U.S. states have implemented regulations toward digital currency trading platforms and money transmitters. There are certain states in the U.S. exchanges won&rsquo;t go near like New York due to the strict Bitlicense guidelines. New York&rsquo;s measure of regulations and guidelines consists of a 44-page document and lots of upfront fees. When the Bitlicense was enacted into law, cryptocurrency startups like Shapeshift, Poloniex, and Xapo left the state and never returned. </span></p>

The formal reasons for the censorship move are different in each case but the end result is the same. In both, regulators have acted on the basis of a law that empowers them to block online sources of information that have been banned in the Russian Federation. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Moscow Restricts Access to Cointelegraph and Coinspot</h2>
<p>The restrictive measures have been imposed against Cointelegraph, a global information source about the latest developments in the crypto space, and Coinspot, a Russian language portal spreading news and other useful information about decentralized digital currencies, fintech trends and financial innovations. Both have been blocked for readers in Russia, starting from October 16.</p>
<p>The formal reason in the case with Cointelegraph is a request from Russia&rsquo;s Federal Tax Service filed on Dec. 25, 2017. The outlet explained that although Cointelegraph was blacklisted almost two years ago, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) technically implemented the ban only this week. It remains unclear why it took the watchdog so long to act.</p>
<figure id="attachment_340638" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-340638" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-340638 size-full" title="Russia Blocks 2 Crypto News Websites" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1082219351.jpg" alt="Russia Blocks 2 Crypto News Websites" width="1000" height="509" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1082219351.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1082219351-300x153.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1082219351-768x391.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1082219351-696x354.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1082219351-825x420.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-340638" class="wp-caption-text">Roskomnadzor</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cointelegraph quoted the developer of a Russian anticensorship browser extension who, on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the block, noting that the website&rsquo;s URL has been added to the blacklist file Roskomnadzor emails to internet service providers. However, it seems not all of them have updated their databases at this point as the website is still available to some users in the country.</p>
<p>The other affected news outlet, Coinspot, has been blocked at the request of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office of Danilovsky District in Volgograd region, Forklog reported. According to an August 22 ruling by the Central District Court of Volgograd, only a single article detailing how to find a blockchain <a href="https://games.bitcoin.com/home">casino</a> had to be taken down. However, most Russian internet providers have restricted access to the whole site.</p>
<p>In both cases, Roskomnadzor&rsquo;s decisions are based on the Law &ldquo;On information, information technology and information protection,&rdquo; which went into force in July, 2006. Its provisions are typically used to justify the blocking of websites containing information the dissemination of which in the Russian Federation has been prohibited for various reasons.</p>
<p>Sarkis Darbinyan, lead legal expert at <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/">Roskomsvoboda</a>, confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com his organization is aware of these developments. The NGO, which is fighting internet censorship in the country, is currently trying to gather more details about the blocking of the websites.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Government Internet Censorship Intensifies</h2>
<p>The Russian telecom regulator has in the past taken actions against other web portals related to cryptocurrencies, usually on request from other government institutions and the judiciary. For example, the supervisory service blocked the online exchanger Buybit.net in April of this year. But there have been also cases where such attempts have failed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340641 size-full" title="Russia Blocks 2 Crypto News Websites" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1189719715.jpg" alt="Russia Blocks 2 Crypto News Websites" width="1000" height="511" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1189719715.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1189719715-300x153.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1189719715-768x392.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1189719715-696x356.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1189719715-822x420.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>In May, Roskomnadzor had to take a similar platform, removing Bestchange.ru from its blacklist after <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-prosecutors-fail-to-block-crypto-website/">prosecutors gave up</a> efforts to block the website citing pending legislation expected to regulate <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">digital assets</a>. In March 2018, the Saint Petersburg City Court <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-strikes-ban-40-bitcoin-sites-russia/">struck down</a> a ban on 40 websites offering information and <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/">services</a> related to cryptocurrencies, and in April, the Supreme Court <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-supreme-court-overturns-decision-to-block-bitcoin-website/">overturned</a> a decision to block the <a href="https://bitcoininfo.ru/">Bitcoininfo.ru</a> portal.</p>
<p>Despite these positive developments, the government has been tightening the noose on the Russian segment of the internet. In March, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/vpn-providers-defy-order-to-connect-to-russias-internet-censor/">demanded</a> that 10 VPN service providers connect to the Federal State Information System, the register that keeps information about all websites that have been banned in Russia.</p>
<p>Later, in April, the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, adopted a law designed to channel Russian internet traffic through routing points controlled by authorities in Moscow and effectively isolate the Russian internet space (Runet) from the rest of the web in the future. It grants Roskomnadzor powers to go after internet providers that refuse to participate in Russia&rsquo;s version of the Great Firewall.</p>

There&rsquo;s no obligation to spend a single sat while scouring the darker recesses of the web, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that should you get the urge, your crypto&rsquo;s good. There are few certainties when shopping on darknet markets (DNMs), but acceptance of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>, and other leading cryptos is a given. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of what the current crop of darknet markets has to offer.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Also read: <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-atm-in-miami-airport-raises-questions-about-traveling-with-crypto/">Bitcoin ATM in Miami Airport Raises Questions About Traveling With Crypto</a></strong></em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Sliding Into the DNMs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although darknet markets are under increased threat from law enforcement, business continues to boom. Every time a darknet market is taken down, a new head of the Hydra springs up in its place. <a href="https://dark.fail/">Dark.fail</a> lists around 20 DNMs, as well as forums and other darknet resources. A cornucopia of forbidden pleasures is but a Tor connection away, but as with all endeavors that involve dabbling in gray or black markets, discretion is advised. Intrepid bitcoiners eager to indulge in a little retail therapy can boot up their browser and mosey down any of the following bazaars.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340579 size-medium" title="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshot-2019-10-18-at-18-13-01-300x83.png" alt="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" width="300" height="83" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshot-2019-10-18-at-18-13-01-300x83.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshot-2019-10-18-at-18-13-01.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Empire Market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Reliance on any single DNM is unwise, as you never know when a site might be busted, backdoored, DDoSed into oblivion, or head for the exits. That said, at this point in time, Empire is the DNM leader by some distance. It&rsquo;s got almost 40,000 listings for drugs alone and has a thriving ecosystem of vendors and customers who congregate on darknet forums like <a href="http://dreadditevelidot.onion">Dread</a>. Empire&rsquo;s a little over a year old, but you wouldn&rsquo;t think it to look at the size of the place. Its subdread board of over 8,000 users vastly exceeds that of any other DNM. If there&rsquo;s one criticism of Empire, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s often offline. That&rsquo;s the trouble with being the king: everyone wants to topple you.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Grey Market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Grey Market is one of the newer DNMs, making its online debut in mid-2019. Despite its youth, it already boasts over 450 vendors and some 4,700 products, from cannabis vape oil to goods aimed at those with a stronger constitution. As a wallet-less market, there&rsquo;s no need to deposit funds before you can shop. For every order, you dispatch coins from a wallet you already control to a newly generated address. In theory, this ensures better security for users. Grey Market accepts <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> and has a 10-tier EXP (experience) structure for vendors.</p>
<figure id="attachment_340572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-340572" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-340572" title="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-1024x595.png" alt="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" width="696" height="404" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-1024x595.png 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-300x174.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-768x446.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-696x404.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-1068x620.png 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon-723x420.png 723w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cannazon.png 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-340572" class="wp-caption-text">Cannazon</figcaption></figure>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Cannazon</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cannazon&rsquo;s logo gives a good indication of the sort of products it offers, with kush lovers well catered for. Like Grey Market, the accepted currencies here are <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> and there&rsquo;s a multisig escrow system which is standard with DNMs. Cannazon has been operating since mid-2016, which is practically forever in the world of darknet markets. One good thing about Cannazon is that they vet vendors pretty hard to ensure a high level of product and service and there are 15 vendor tiers. Unlike Grey Market, Cannazon will not ship to or from the U.S.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Cryptonia</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptonia cares about security. That&rsquo;s why, as soon as you alight on the site, you&rsquo;re bludgeoned with reassurances: &ldquo;Cryptonia features the most secure 2/3 Bitcoin Multisig implementation of any market, a transparent wallet-less escrow system&rdquo; and so forth. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> are the accepted cryptocurrencies, and though the UX isn&rsquo;t a strong point, the thousands of product listings more than compensate.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Tochka</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Whatever your poison, you&rsquo;ll find it on Tochka. This DNM, which has been operating since 2014, offers a seven-day escrow system and two-of-three multisig. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> are the favored currencies. Over 6,800 products are on sale at the time of writing, from just under 600 vendors: everything from seeds and edibles to viagra and growth hormone. Interestingly, Tochka has joined forced with DNMAvengers, a forum dedicated to reducing harm and spreading awareness via testing of products suspected of containing adulterants. What&rsquo;s more, the site allows dead drops, should customers wish to subtly pick up their wares from a prearranged location.</p>
<figure id="attachment_340582" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-340582" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-340582" title="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-1024x592.png" alt="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" width="696" height="402" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-1024x592.png 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-300x173.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-768x444.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-696x402.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-1068x617.png 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka-727x420.png 727w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tochka.png 1161w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-340582" class="wp-caption-text">Tochka</figcaption></figure>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Apollon</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With over 10,000 listings for drugs alone, Apollon can&rsquo;t be accused of scrimping on choice. It accepts a good selection of cryptocurrencies too: bitcoin cash as well as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. It&rsquo;s a traditional direct deposit market, so you need to fund your wallet address and wait for the deposit to clear before you can order. There&rsquo;s nothing novel about Apollon, but that&rsquo;s okay. The mere existence of multiple DNMs, no matter how generic, lessens the likelihood of them all becoming unavailable at once.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340570" title="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apollon.png" alt="6 Darknet Markets for the Crypto Curious" width="117" height="40"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Needless to say, if you do decide to avail yourself of any of the aforementioned darknet markets &ndash; or any others not included in this list &ndash; keep your opsec on point and exercise caution at every pass.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Messenger to Halt Operations With Grams</h2>
<p>Lawyers representing Telegram Group and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ton Issuer Inc., have filed documents containing their clients&rsquo; proposal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, Tass reported. The entities behind the Telegram Open Network (TON) have also expressed disagreement with some of the demands put forward by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>On October 11, the regulator <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-212">announced</a> that it had obtained a temporary restraining order for Telegram&rsquo;s ICO. The court will conduct a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/telegram-awaits-court-hearing-on-sec-case-against-its-token-sale/">hearing</a> on the case on October 24. Due to the legal proceedings, the company now offers to effectively freeze the blockchain project. Before the SEC filed its lawsuit, TON was scheduled to launch by the end of this month.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-340527 size-full" title="Telegram Offers to Postpone Launch of the TON Network" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1009394536.jpg" alt="Telegram Offers to Postpone Launch of the TON Network" width="1000" height="541" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1009394536.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1009394536-300x162.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1009394536-768x415.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1009394536-696x377.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1009394536-776x420.jpg 776w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The court has already satisfied some of the SEC&rsquo;s demands regarding Telegram&rsquo;s plans. The regulator claims the messaging platform held an unregistered offering of TON&rsquo;s native GRM tokens. In two private sales between January and March 2018, Telegram sold the rights to 2.9 billion coins to 171 investors worldwide for $1.7 billion. The total includes a billion tokens bought by 39 U.S. residents for $424.5 million.</p>
<p>Telegram is now proposing to halt the sale and transfer of its <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">cryptocurrency</a> for a period of five months to give the court enough time to resolve the legal issues. In the recent filing, it also declared its commitment to inform the Securities and Exchange Commission 30 days before it starts any operations with the gram tokens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">SEC Rejects Proposal</h2>
<p>Telegram&rsquo;s petition to the district court notes that over the past 18 months the company has voluntarily cooperated with the commission and requested its feedback regarding the launch of TON and gram. Its developers even introduced changes to the blockchain platform to address some of the concerns expressed by the SEC.</p>
<p>The lawyers disagree with the regulator&rsquo;s opinion that gram is a security and insist the token has to be regarded as a currency. The Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom law firm, which represents the messenger, has asked the court to relieve Telegram of the obligation to meet a number of demands and respond to new requests for additional information from the SEC.</p>
<p>However, in its own petition to the court, the commission argues that a postponement of the launch would not be enough. The regulator claims that such arrangement would allow Telegram to continue to commit offenses. If the court does not establish the appropriate prohibitions for the duration of the proceedings, future violations related to the distribution of gram are guaranteed, the SEC insists.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Investors Asked to Vote on April 30 Deadline</h2>
<p>Reaching out to the participants in the two fundraising rounds held last year, Telegram has updated investors on the situation around the TON project and its disagreement with the SEC&rsquo;s arguments. In recent correspondence with investors, the company asked them to share their position on the proposed extension of the deadline for the network.</p>
<p>In case the majority agrees, the messenger plans to proceed with a new launch date before April 30, 2020, using the time to make additional investments and further develop the blockchain platform. However, if either of the two groups of investors disagrees with the delayed start, they will be partially compensated and fewer gram tokens will be issued at launch.</p>
