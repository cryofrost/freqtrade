The event in Emeryville will kick off San Francisco Blockchain Week and will feature several California elected officials and well-known blockchain executives.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Taking Crypto to a New High: An Event Showcasing Cred&rsquo;s Global Merchant Solution</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://universalprotocol.io/">Universal Protocol Alliance</a> (UPA) and <a href="https://www.mycred.io/">Cred</a> have organized an event at the Ohana Dispensary in conjunction with San Francisco Blockchain Week. News.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/california-city-official-uses-bitcoin-cash-to-purchase-cannabis/">reported</a> on the UPA and Cred making headway in California when Berkeley City Councilmember Ben Bartlett became the first elected official to make a purchase using bitcoin cash. The purchase at the <a href="https://ohanacannabis.com/">Ohana </a>dispensary ended up settling instantly in a stablecoin which helps the merchant avoid digital currency volatility.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-343004" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="400" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh-300x80.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh-768x205.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh-1024x273.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh-696x186.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh-1392x371.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cred9000988777hhhh-1068x285.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></p>
<p>The cofounder of Cred, Dan Schatt, told news.Bitcoin.com that the event on Wednesday will also showcase a live demonstration of the PoS hardware running the Cred financial operating system. The business will accept cryptocurrency and settle instantly in the Alliance UPUSD stablecoin for the merchant and the city tax collector&rsquo;s convenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several California politicians will be on hand, including local mayors and city council members in the bay area and county assessors,&rdquo; Schatt detailed. &ldquo;We will also have crypto industry leaders &ndash; the CEOs of Cred, Uphold, Bitcoin.com, Omisego, and journalists.&rdquo; Schatt added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>A few things will be presented that have never been possible: instant tax collection, particularly in an industry that only collects 17% of tax revenue, instant settlement with the merchant (this usually takes three days with Square), the opportunity for merchants to earn interest on their proceeds and to borrow.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Digital Currency Innovation Coupled With Frictionless Stablecoin Settlement</h2>
<p>The event invitation notes there will be music, food, and cocktails. Special guests will include members of the <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</a>, Bitcoin.com CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/esports-cannabis-and-bch-first-ama-with-bitcoin-com-ceo-stefan-rust/">Stefan Rust</a>, Mayor of Emeryville Ally Medina, and Berkeley Councilmember Ben Bartlett. The event will not only display the powerful potential of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash but also the innovation behind stablecoins. The Universal Dollar (UPUSD) is a stablecoin issued by the Universal Protocol and the first stablecoin to be listed on Uphold. Every UPUSD is backed by the U.S. dollar and coins are minted on-chain with every transaction written to Ethereum.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-343007" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jkkkk.jpg" alt="" width="775" height="250" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jkkkk.jpg 775w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jkkkk-300x97.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jkkkk-768x248.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jkkkk-696x225.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;The UPUSD stablecoin is completely transparent and 1:1 substantiated with USD. This demonstrates the power of several companies coming together to support the very practical use case of providing significantly better financial services to cash-intensive industries,&rdquo; Schatt told news.Bitcoin.com. &ldquo;Every transaction, whether it is facilitated with a debit, credit, prepaid or <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> &mdash; Paying results in the purchase of LBA as a translation utility token, which is then collateralized and UPUSD is advanced to the merchant. It requires a lot of companies working together &mdash; Cred as a licensed lender, the Universal Alliance as the minter of the stablecoin, the integration of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> in the PoS system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event &ldquo;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/taking-crypto-to-a-new-high-tickets-76095721351?aff=eemailordconf&utm_campaign=order_confirm&utm_medium=email&ref=eemailordconf&utm_source=eventbrite&utm_term=viewevent">Taking Crypto to a New High</a>&rdquo; at the Ohana Dispensary on October 30 will start at 5:30 p.m. and the organizers say &ldquo;make sure to bring your Crypto wallet to experience a revolutionary new use case for blockchain.&rdquo; Moreover, free transportation will be provided to credentialed San Francisco Blockchain Week attendees. If you are attending the blockchain conference in the Bay area and want to see a revolutionary global merchant solution, then register for the free event <strong><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/taking-crypto-to-a-new-high-tickets-76095721351?aff=eemailordconf&utm_campaign=order_confirm&utm_medium=email&ref=eemailordconf&utm_source=eventbrite&utm_term=viewevent">here</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Crypto Capital Leadership Accused of Money Laundering</h2>
<p>Crypto Capital is a payment processor that handled funds for and on behalf of Bitfinex for several years according to public court documents. The cryptocurrency exchange accuses Crypto Capital of causing it to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>On Thursday it was reported that the payments processor&rsquo;s president, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, was extradited to Poland from Greece to answer charges related to money laundering. Another principal of the company, Oz Yosef, was indicted on three criminal counts by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Bitfinex has issued a <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on the matter, saying that it was not involved in money laundering and that it has been lied to by Crypto Capital representatives including Molina and Yosef. Bitfinex claims that Crypto Capital falsely referred to its integrity, banking expertise, robust compliance program and financial licenses to reassure it was capable of handling the company&rsquo;s transactions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">International Legal Saga</h2>
<p>According to media <a href="https://wpolityce.pl/kryminal/470013-poszukiwany-ena-ivan-manuel-molina-lee-jest-juz-w-polsce">reports</a> from Poland, the allegations against the president of Crypto Capital include laundering funds for an international drug cartel from Colombia via Bitfinex and transferring them to Polish bank accounts. The reports mention that investigators found that from December 2016 to February 2018 approximately PLN 1.4 billion (US $360 million) was transferred to these accounts, which have been seized by authorities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitfinex is the victim of a fraud and is making its position clear to the relevant authorities, including those in Poland and the United States,&rdquo; stated the company&rsquo;s general counsel Stuart Hoegner on Friday. &ldquo;We cannot speak about Crypto Capital&rsquo;s other clients, but any suggestion that Crypto Capital laundered drug proceeds or any other illicit funds at the behest of Bitfinex or its customers is categorically false. This week&rsquo;s developments do nothing to affect or otherwise deter Bitfinex&rsquo;s claims to funds in Poland or anywhere else. We will continue to work to recover all funds for and on behalf of our stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Strong Trading Volume Growth</h2>
<p>Banking services may be restricted and the government may be considering a bill to ban cryptocurrencies, but Indians continue to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Trading volumes on some exchanges in the country have been rising significantly.</p>
<p>Paxful has reported steady growth in <a href="https://coin.dance/volume/paxful/INR/BTC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BTC trading in INR</a> on its peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin marketplace. For the week ending Oct. 26, 85 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were traded, a 13% increase from the 75 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded the previous week. In comparison, only 7 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were traded in the week ending Oct. 27 last year on the platform. Competing P2P marketplace <a href="https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/INR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Localbitcoins</a> reported 146 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded in the week ending Oct. 26 and 143 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> the previous week. Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s <a href="https://local.bitcoin.com/offers/India">P2P marketplace</a> for bitcoin cash is also growing in popularity among Indian traders.</p>

<p>Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, is also seeing an encouraging trend on his platform. Trading volume has &ldquo;grown really well this month,&rdquo; he told news.Bitcoin.com on Monday, adding that &ldquo;It has accelerated in the last week due to the positive sentiments around crypto.&rdquo; He further shared that the top coins traded this month on his exchange are <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>, MATIC, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, BAT, and BTT.</p>
<p>Regarding trader sentiment in India, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been very positive ever since the China news of President Xi Jinping announcing that China should get into accelerated blockchain development,&rdquo; Shetty opined. &ldquo;India and China share a very competitive relationship. This means we&rsquo;re going to see positive crypto announcements in India as well very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-343026 aligncenter" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flag-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flag-1.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flag-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flag-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flag-1-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flag-1-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The CEO continued: &ldquo;The last couple of months were relatively slower compared to Q2 this year. But that&rsquo;s been the situation throughout the crypto sector globally. Indian markets have always been on par with global crypto markets in terms of trader sentiments and excitement. However, the China news has created tremendous positive outlook in the last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sumit Gupta, CEO of local crypto exchange Coindcx, believes that &ldquo;Trader sentiment has considerably improved in India lately, mainly because of the market reversal,&rdquo; he told news.Bitcoin.com on Monday. &ldquo;In 2019, change in market sentiments brought an inflow of new traders and new users (hodlers),&rdquo; he added, emphasizing that &ldquo;strong gains and volatility have attracted traders&rdquo; this year.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Diwali Festival and Crypto Trading</h2>
<p>India is currently celebrating a very popular five-day Hindu festival called Diwali or the Festival of Lights which began on Oct. 25. It &ldquo;marks the beginning of a new year for businessmen who believe it to be an auspicious day which brings in wealth and prosperity throughout the year,&rdquo; Coindcx explained. &ldquo;Goddess Laxmi showers her blessings on the occasion of Diwali and therefore, any buy or sell trading brings a good fortune in the upcoming year.&rdquo; To mark the importance of this festival, a number of crypto exchanges are running specials and giveaways.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-343025 aligncenter" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diwali.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diwali.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diwali-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diwali-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diwali-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diwali-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>U.K.-based banking services platform Cashaa also picked the start of this festival to launch its crypto service for Indian users, as news.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashaa-launches-banking-solution-for-indian-crypto-owners/">previously reported</a>. The company has since provided additional details of its service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the occasion of Diwali, a festival for wealth and prosperity, we are announcing the launch of INR deposits with buy and sell of bitcoin, ether, and Cashaa for Indian residents, up to 1 crore INR [~$141,128] per month. Min deposit amount is 25,000 INR up to 10 lakh INR in a single transaction,&rdquo; Cashaa detailed. The company explained that it &ldquo;was able to find a stable P2P solution through its vast network of traders and brokers in India&rdquo; to launch the service. &ldquo;Our system will solve the problem of liquidity and speed using a P2P engine at the backend which does all the complex work and makes buying and selling simple for average users.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Indian Crypto Bill and Regulation</h2>
<p>The Indian government has been sitting on a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-crypto-bill-supreme-court-hearing/">draft bill</a> that seeks to ban all cryptocurrencies except state-issued ones since February. The government has indicated to the country&rsquo;s supreme court that this bill may be introduced in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-introduce-crypto-bill-next-parliament-session-community-responses/">next session</a> of parliament.</p>
<p>The Indian crypto community believes that the bill is flawed and has been actively <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/calls-intensify-indian-government-regulate-cryptocurrency/">campaigning</a> for the government to reexamine the bill. Shetty himself has been running a social media campaign called &ldquo;India Wants Crypto,&rdquo; which is only a few days short of its one year anniversary. He shared with news.Bitcoin.com that &ldquo;the campaign has led to us meeting a few elected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-parliament-member-helping-crypto-community-influence-regulation/">representatives</a> of the Indian parliament,&rdquo; emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ll continue the campaign and we&rsquo;re sure our elected representatives will hear our demands and help the crypto sector in India.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the banking restrictions imposed by the central bank are still <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rbi-power-over-crypto-indian-supreme-court/">in effect</a>. The ban has been challenged in the supreme court, which is expected to resume hearing the case on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-supreme-court-postpones-crypto-case-to-november/">Nov. 19</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Dream That Never Dies</h2>
<p>For math geeks, key cracking is a question of statistical probability and for hopeless dreamers, a question of ambition. Long shots capture the imagination of simple mammalian minds, and for those who wish to rage against the odds, the lottery is a game for the faint of heart &ndash; the finest display of sheer dumb mathematical bravery is in trying to brute force Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org">Bitcointalk</a> forum, a related thread from Jun 11, 2018, continues to garner replies to this day. In &lsquo;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4453897.0">BitCrack &ndash; A tool for brute-forcing private keys</a>,&rsquo; board members disassemble the prospects of making a brute force breakthrough with software specially designed for that task, with the most sober minds strongly dismissing the quest as a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>An early response from user Coin-1 politely attempts to dissuade anyone from proceeding any further: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s calculate how much time you need to crack one Bitcoin-address on your machine. You said that your performance is 9 million BTC-addresses per second, i.e. approximately 2<sup>23</sup> BTC-addresses per second. Thus the brute forcing will take 2<sup>160-23</sup> = 2<sup>137</sup>seconds! I guess it is more than septillion (10<sup>24</sup>) years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On an ordinary computer, attempting to extract funds from a bitcoin wallet to which you didn&rsquo;t have the key would be a fool&rsquo;s errand. What if, however, you had a faster, better computer that could attempt many more keys per second &ndash; would the tough nut of Bitcoin be a little easier to crack?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>The first step in overcoming a challenge is in quantifying it. To do that we must look at exactly how many potential keys exist. A private wallet key is simply a number between 1 and 2256 and to brute force it all you need is to continue guessing until you hit the right number between 1 and 115 quattuorvigintillion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard number for the human brain to process, but to put it in perspective, it&rsquo;s greater than the estimated number of atoms in the universe. At that scale, even the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputer &ndash; IBM&rsquo;s Summit &ndash; if tasked with brute forcing Bitcoin would effectively take forever to break just one wallet, which would test the patience of even the most determined hacker.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342973" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brute-force.png" alt="How Hard Is It to Brute Force a Bitcoin Private Key?" width="852" height="480" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brute-force.png 852w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brute-force-300x169.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brute-force-768x433.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brute-force-696x392.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/brute-force-746x420.png 746w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wallet Recovery</h2>
<p>This sheer uselessness of brute force will dash the hopes of anyone who has ever lost their password or seed phrase and cannot recover their bitcoin, but for those in that very situation, all may not be lost. If you remember at least part of the password, a service such as <a href="https://walletrecoveryservices.com/">Wallet Recovery Services</a> may be able to assist. For most cryptocurrencies, however, you&rsquo;ll need to trust the company with your full wallet. In the case of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, it is apparently possible to engage the service <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=240779.0;all">without handing over the full wallet</a>.</p>
<p>If successful in cracking the wallet, a fee equal to 20% of the wallet&rsquo;s holdings will be incurred, but it&rsquo;s a no win, no fee endeavor. As always, it&rsquo;s worth examining how the process works and doing your own research before deciding whether to engage these types of services.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Quantum of Solace</h2>
<p>For some time now, quantum computing has been the great fear for the continued security and fidelity of Bitcoin, with cynics suggesting that private key cracking may be just around the corner. Recently those fears were stoked when Google announced it had reached &ldquo;quantum supremacy,&rdquo; completing a computation in just over three minutes that it claimed would have taken a conventional computer 10,000 years.</p>
<p>It was enough to spark debate in the crypto community, for whom quantum computing is a bogeyman trotted out at regular intervals to spread FUD. However, as sober heads including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-googles-quantum-breakthrough-means-for-blockchain-cryptography/">news.Bitcoin.com</a> counseled, this was not the hammer blow promised.</p>
<p>Now, IBM have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ibm-googles-quantum-leap-quantum-flop/">rubbished Google&rsquo;s claims</a>. While Google had stated it would take 10,000 years for a conventional computer to complete the computation, a recent blog post from IBM said: &ldquo;We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My one-sentence impression of recent quantum supremacy stuff so far is that it is to real quantum computing what hydrogen bombs are to nuclear fusion. Proof that a phenomenon and the capability to extract power from it exist, but still far from directed use toward useful things.</p>
<p>&mdash; Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1187179705025196034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>John Devadoss, Head of Global Development for <a href="https://neo.org/">NEO</a>, and a quantum computing authority, told news.Bitcoin.com: &ldquo;The quantum computing bogeyman is a bit like the AI bogeyman. First, there are way too many snake-oil salesmen, even in academia, because they want funding for their labs. Second, whilst progress is being made, albeit in arcane niche focus areas, the impractically high error rates coupled with the research lab-like constraints implies that real-world usage is way off on the horizon, if at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, at least, it seems that quantum computing has yet to make the necessary quantum leap forward to trouble Bitcoin&rsquo;s encryption. Cryptocurrency holders should remain vigilant to security threats, but brute force attacks should not keep them up at night. Successfully completing the heist would take an eternity, and ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethical Relativism and Central Banking</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The political lie: </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tag/central-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are said to facilitate commerce and to benefit customers by connecting them globally. They purport to guarantee money and the safety of transactions. In fact, central banks are a chokepoint for commerce, which benefits the elite at the expense of ordinary people. Their mandated fiat constitutes the largest, longest, and farthest-reaching financial scam ever perpetuated. The fiat-money scam is committed by the political class upon productive people. The central banks&rsquo; transactions are the opposite of what is claimed; they betray customers in order to enrich the state with access to the wealth and personal information of average people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The philosophical lie: To sustain a massive falsehood over time, facts must be constantly denied. Otherwise, people will hold the scam up to reality and check it against evidence. The falsehood needs to blur the truth, or destroy it, so that facts become discredited. If the lie is successful over time, people come to believe that the way things are right now&mdash;what they are told is &ldquo;true&rdquo;&mdash;is the way things have always been and must always be. Nothing but the lie is practical or possible.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Things Used to Be</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn&rsquo;t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> always this way, and history is the greatest reality check of all. The depravity of paper money was once common political knowledge, for example. Consider </span><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/founders-warned-us-about-central-banking"><span style="font-weight: 400;">America&rsquo;s Founding Fathers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Paper money has had the effect in your state that it will ever have, to ruin commerce, oppress the honest, and open the door to every species of fraud and injustice.&rdquo; </span><a href="https://founders.archives.gov/GEWN-04-04-02-0428"><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first U.S. President.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Paper money is unjust; to creditors, if a legal tender; to debtors, if not legal tender, by increasing the difficulty of getting specie. It is unconstitutional, for it affects the rights of property as much as taking away equal value in land. It is pernicious, destroying confidence between individuals; discouraging commerce&hellip;&rdquo; </span><a href="https://www.constitution.org/gb/gb-plea.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Madison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &ldquo;Father of the Constitution.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To emit an unfunded paper as the sign of value ought not to continue a formal part of the Constitution, nor ever hereafter to be employed; being, in its nature, pregnant with abuses, and liable to be made the engine of imposition and fraud; holding out temptations equally pernicious to the integrity of government and to the morals of the people.&rdquo; </span><a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-03-02-0272"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander Hamilton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, first Treasury Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-13-02-0120#TSJN-01-13-0122-kw-0002"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 1788 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Thomas Jefferson&mdash;author of the Declaration of Independence&mdash;used an interesting word to describe paper money: &ldquo;ghost.&rdquo;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_342948" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-342948" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-342948" title="The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson.jpg" alt="The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson-696x464.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson-630x420.jpg 630w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jefferson-190x128.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-342948" class="wp-caption-text">Thomas Jefferson</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There is no saying where this fire [bankruptcies in London] will end. Perhaps in the general conflagration of all their paper. If not now, it must ere long. With only 20 millions of coin, and three or four hundred million of circulating paper, public and private, nothing is necessary but a general panic, produced either by failures, invasion or any other cause, and the whole visionary fabric vanishes into air and shews that paper is poverty, that it is only the ghost of money, and not money itself.&rdquo; In 1817, Jefferson added that paper money&rsquo;s &ldquo;abuses also are inevitable and, by breaking up the measure of value, make a lottery of all private property.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ghost of Money</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As accurate as the other Founding Fathers were, Jefferson pointed to a more fundamental issue. Paper currency was &ldquo;the ghost of money&rdquo;; coins were the reality. They were opposites of each other, like lies and truth, with one being a phantom and the other being the substance of life. Paper money is not merely an expression of and a pathway to corruption, it is also an existential parallel to free-market money. (&ldquo;Existential&rdquo; here means that fiat affirms the existence of money by being a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of it, even while contradicting money&rsquo;s substance.) </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342944" title="The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-ghost.jpg" alt="The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks" width="1000" height="800" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-ghost.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-ghost-300x240.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-ghost-768x614.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-ghost-696x557.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-ghost-525x420.jpg 525w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge for central banks is to make the phantom seem real and the reality seem fraudulent. One way to do so is to question the validity of objective reality itself. After all, if there is no objective reality&mdash;if reality is dictated by authorities, the narrative, the majority, or other subjective forces&mdash;then there is nothing factual against which to assess anything. When nothing is objectively false or true, a lie is as valid as the truth.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethical Relativism</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a culture of relativism, which supports the denial of reality&mdash;a denial that sustains the pervasive lie of central banking. Ethical relativism argues that there is no absolute truth; no objective standard or empirical evidence underlies ethics and personal judgment. Ethical relativism can be divided into different categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descriptive ethical relativism studies people&rsquo;s beliefs about morality, often focusing upon the beliefs of collectives such as tribes or specific societies. It is sometimes called &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; because it contrasts different approaches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta-ethical relativism claims that moral judgments are not true or false in any provable or objective sense; they are relative to a perspective or circumstances&mdash;that is, they are subjective. This idea underlies all relativism. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normative moral relativism, a subset of normative ethics, asks how people should act. Relativism answers that no moral standards bind all men at all times because right and wrong are not universal. Killing an innocent man is not always wrong, for example.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(The opposite of Ethical Relativism is Absolutism&mdash;the doctrine that actions are intrinsically right or wrong. Killing an innocent person </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inherently wrong, even if it is done for the greater good or some other perceived benefit.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A venue in which many people encounter ethical relativism in a pure form is in introductory college courses in philosophy. The professor poses a hypothetical in order to make students re-examine their ethical codes. The scenario usually runs, &ldquo;The entire nation of France will drop dead tomorrow morning unless you kill your neighbor who is an innocent man. What do you do?&rdquo; Or:&ldquo;You can eliminate cancer by pressing a button that will also kill one healthy person who is an innocent man. Do you push the button?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such questions are illusions of a moral dilemma; they are ghosts. They are supposed to pit the moral horror of participating in mass murder against the moral horror of killing an innocent person in order to make a student conclude that there is no correct choice. Morality is relative, not absolute. But the questions are ghosts because they cannot be honestly answered. They postulate a parallel world in which the rules of reality, like cause and effect, have been so dramatically changed that pushing a button cures cancer. This world operates on magic, not objective reality.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Truthful Response to a False Dichotomy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, there is one honest answer: &ldquo;Because my ethics and actions are based on the facts and physical rules of the world around me, I don&rsquo;t know what I would do if those facts and rules no longer existed. If I were in a totally different reality, I&rsquo;m sure my ethics and actions would be different, but I don&rsquo;t know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; This answer is the opposite of what the faux dilemmas are intended to elicit, of course, because it asserts reality rather than blurring it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, yet, this sort of question is commonly viewed as a &ldquo;tough&rdquo; moral issue. After all, how can the life of one person outweigh that of millions? This query is another intellectual sleight of hand. Morality is being reduced to a numbers game, a cost-benefit analysis, rather than a matter of principle. The subject is now utilitarianism, not ethics, as the professor claims. This is the destruction of objective morality. Into the resulting vacuum, utilitarianism rushes, usually in the company of expert opinion and authoritative pronouncements.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342946" title="The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right.jpg" alt="The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right-696x464.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right-630x420.jpg 630w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/right-190x128.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right and Wrong Are Not All Relative</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is right or wrong is one of the most fundamental decisions a person can make. If the person is persuaded to abdicate his ethical judgment to an authority or a gray zone&mdash;if there is no objective morality or reality&mdash;then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decisions and judgments are based on relativism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implications of this for central banking are twofold: a moral and a metaphysical relativism that benefits lies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banking is immoral. Fiat money and its inevitable inflation are theft; the banking monopoly robs people of opportunity and prosperity; the punishment of financial dissenters, such as black marketeers, negates freedom by denying individuals the use of their own property. This is a problem for central banking because it is an oppressive double standard, and people rebel against blatant injustice. The problem of backlash against a double standard can be eliminated, however, by removing morality itself from the picture. Without objective morality, there is no objective justice. Everything is a matter of authority, expert opinion, circumstance, and utility. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three-Pronged Propaganda</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banking is a metaphysical lie that requires the discrediting of fact. Lies are used to establish the superiority of state-controlled finances over a privately-controlled system and so gin up people&rsquo;s compliance. The propaganda is basically three-pronged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Private alternatives are depicted as either criminal or fraught with danger &ndash; or both. The criminal accusations against cryptocurrency, for example, include human trafficking, tax evasion, drug dealing, and money laundering; the accusations are incredibly exaggerated and equally valid against fiat currency. The dangers include fraud, ransom attacks (blackmail), and the free market. Fraud and blackmail are not unique to crypto, of course, and the free-market cure for both is the exercise of due diligence and protective technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demonization of the free market is a different matter; it is political and philosophical. Self-interest and voluntary exchange are vilified for the sole reason that they are antithetical to the state. The free market is the state&rsquo;s main competition because it actually provides what the state promises but cannot deliver: freedom, prosperity, peace, and a civil society. Competition is not permitted, especially when it is effective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) The state argues that its financial institutions are public goods while private alternatives are ruthless, chaotic, and incompetent systems that offer no recourse to exploited individuals. The smear campaign is backed up by a horde of authorities who are a mixture of the scholarly, the bureaucratic, and the heavily armed. Above all, people must be discouraged from comparing the current financial system with alternatives from the past or possibilities in the future that would call the lie into question. As in the philosophy class, the rules of reality must be altered; in this case, the rules of the marketplace must be discredited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Some people always see through the propaganda. These people are targeted and punished for acting on their disagreement in order to discourage others from doing so. This is the point at which propaganda becomes a gun.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendacious Money-Printers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central banks know truth from lies; they know what they are doing. &ldquo;</span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dutch-national-bank-says-gold-can-re-start-economy-in-case-of-total-collapse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dutch National Bank Says Gold Can Re-Start Economy in Case of Total Collapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; The De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) or Dutch Central Bank recently acknowledged that its system of lies was faltering. </span><a href="https://www.dnb.nl/betalingsverkeer/goud/index.jsp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNB stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &ldquo;if the [central banking] system collapses, the gold stock can serve as a basis to build it up again.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold bolsters confidence in the stability of the central bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and creates a sense of security.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement is a rare admission of reality. Central banking&rsquo;s structure has become so transparently unstable and fraudulent that people have lost their confidence and sense of security in it. Central banks now pin their hopes on a store of value that is supported by five centuries of history and private choice &ndash; gold. Many hedge even this relatively safe bet by forging or incorporating digital currencies, often </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/global-crypto-war-is-heating-up-iran-next-in-line-with-its-own-gold-backed-coin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backed by gold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or other hard commodities. Central bankers realize that the smoke they have been blowing into mirrors needs to be rescued by a form of wealth that people trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As central banking crumbles, so does the lie. The truth can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Digital Currency Market Prices Hold New Foundations</h2>
<p>Over the last three days, digital currency prices have seen the biggest price jumps in over a month and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are far more optimistic toward the future. For instance, on Friday, October 25 the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> increased from a low of $7,300 to a high of $10,295 during the afternoon trading sessions. Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) saw prices lift from $215 to a high of $277 per coin. Since then, prices retraced a hair southbound losing some value, but crypto prices are much higher than they were during last week&rsquo;s bearish cycle. At the time of writing, the price per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is roughly $9,527 per coin and the digital asset is up 18% for the week. Behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> which has gained 5.4% during the course of the last seven days. One <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is swapping for $183 a coin and there&rsquo;s $10 billion in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> trades worldwide.</p>

<p>Ripple (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>) saw the least gains this week, only climbing 2% so far. Each <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> is trading for $0.29 and there&rsquo;s around $2 billion in global trades this Sunday. Lastly, the fifth position is held by tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) after bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) bumped tether out of fourth spot. According to Coinlib.io, tether is capturing just a little less than two thirds of every trade between nearly every top digital currency. Tether has around $36 billion of worldwide trades which is roughly $7 billion more than <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chinese President Xi Jinping Embraces Blockchain Technology</h2>
<p>In the last 48 hours, traders and speculators have been trying to guess why the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and many other coins spiked considerably on Friday. Some people have attributed the jump to the President of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China Xi Jinping&rsquo;s comments on blockchain technology. Xi Jinping&rsquo;s comments follow the ban against trading cryptocurrencies in 2017 and the Chinese government has previously been negative towards the technology.</p>
<figure id="attachment_342901" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-342901" style="width: 1150px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-342901 size-full" title="Market Update: Crypto Prices Hold Steady After Massive Bullish Spike" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh.jpg" alt="Market Update: Crypto Prices Hold Steady After Massive Bullish Spike" width="1150" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh.jpg 1150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh-300x130.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh-768x334.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh-1024x445.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh-696x303.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh-1068x464.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dggdhddhdhdhhdhdh-966x420.jpg 966w" sizes="(max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-342901" class="wp-caption-text">Xi Jinping is positive about blockchain technology and many speculators believe it has primed cryptocurrency markets.</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, despite the angst against digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), the government has allowed blockchain projects to flourish. At the 18th Political Bureau of the Central Committee collective study in Beijing, Xi Jinping said that a &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo; should be applied to distributed ledger technology platforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies,&rdquo; Xi Jinping emphasized at the event. The President added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>We must clarify the main direction, increase investment, focus on a number of key core technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">John McAfee Doubles Down His Prediction</h2>
<p>The infamous John McAfee doubled down on his forecast that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will touch $1 million per coin at the end of 2020. McAfee says the price will reach $2 million by the end of 2020 as he&rsquo;s changed his prediction three, times raising it every time. At first, McAfee said the price would be $500,000, but quickly upped the prediction and even told the public he would chop off his family jewels on live television if the price didn&rsquo;t make it that high. &ldquo;Run the f***ing numbers &mdash; If bitcoin is less than $2 million by the end of 2020, then mathematics itself is a flawed disappointment,&rdquo; McAfee explained.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Xi Jinping&rsquo;s Comments Helped Bitcoin Skip the Death Cross</h2>
<p>According to a few analysts, three days ago <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was heading toward a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-crypto-prices-spike-significantly-in-a-matter-of-minutes/">death cross scenario</a> where the 50-day moving average dropped below the 200-day moving average. However, many market pundits believe Xi Jinping&rsquo;s statements were the driving force behind the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price push. &ldquo;Leading up to Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Libra hearing, bitcoin had sold-off as many traders put on bearish positions,&rdquo; John Todaro, director of digital currency research for Tradeblock, said after the spike. &ldquo;The technical set up looked negative, but then President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s commentary around blockchain technology was an unexpected positive catalyst that caught some bearish traders off guard in my view, leading to the upward movement which likely brought in more speculators as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded above key thresholds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The managing director of crypto derivatives platform Amulet, Marouane Garcon, agrees that the Chinese President&rsquo;s optimism toward blockchain is a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were quite a lot of liquidations but I think it&rsquo;s still mostly about President Xi&rsquo;s announcement because people know that his green light will cause a ripple effect across China,&rdquo; Garcon <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2019/10/25/bitcoin-rallies-close-to-40-in-24-hours/#32e77be71594">explained</a> to the media. &ldquo;The space needs China&rsquo;s involvement &mdash; If China would&rsquo;ve never banned crypto trading and exchanges the space would be a lot bigger today &mdash; Having China onboard, in my opinion, is just as good if not better than having America onboard.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">2016 Crypto Market Revival</h2>
<p>After the past few weeks of bearish sentiment and the sudden bullish upswing this week a few observers believe things are looking an awful lot like 2016. The CEO of Sibex, Daniel Haudenschild, detailed that the spike is due to the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> halving that&rsquo;s forthcoming. It is estimated that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block reward will chop in half on May 14, 2020, depending on the hashrate processing power.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-342904 size-full" title="Market Update: Crypto Prices Hold Steady After Massive Bullish Spike" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs.jpg" alt="Market Update: Crypto Prices Hold Steady After Massive Bullish Spike" width="1150" height="379" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs.jpg 1150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs-300x99.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs-768x253.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs-1024x337.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs-696x229.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshhshhshhs-1068x352.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming into a time where the Bitcoin price is being affected by halving, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s inflation rate recently dropping from 3.8% to 1.8%,&rdquo; Haudenschild remarked. &ldquo;Prices typically increase significantly leading up to the halving and have been followed both times by a 10x move just a few weeks later. The 2016 halving started a rally that brought <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices from $600 to $19,000 just one month after the halving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overall the market prices of all 2,000+ digital assets have improved a great deal which has given enthusiasts and traders more hope. Today crypto bulls are trying to press past upper resistance as Sunday&rsquo;s trading sessions have been feverish. Global trade volume has doubled and there&rsquo;s now been $100 billion worth of cryptos traded in the last 24 hours.</p>

While in every place they are caused by complex local issues, there is a global problem that is an underlying trend: low interest rates which make it impossible for young people to save for their future and at the same time push housing prices to become unattainable. And people with no future are easy to take to the streets. Cryptocurrency offers an alternative in the form of taking away governments&rsquo; power to control people&rsquo;s money.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Global Generational Revolution Is Brewing</h2>
<p>At least 17 people have already died in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cash-runs-dry-at-atms-as-protests-escalate-in-chile/">Chile</a> as a result of clashes between protesters and security forces that were sparked by a minor hike in public transportation prices. In <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lebanese-protestors-gather-at-central-bank-as-financial-lockout-continues/">Lebanon</a> members of different religious and ethnic sects have joined forces to fight against a tax on Whatsapp calls. And the people of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economic-turmoil-in-hong-kong-escalates-as-colonial-era-law-is-imposed/">Hong Kong</a> continue their protests against the administration, despite the fact that the extradition law to mainland China that triggered it has already been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Other incidents of anti-government protests recently occurred in Catalonia, Spain, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guinea and Iraq. These events are the result of varied local issues that appear to be unconnected, but the fact that they are all happening around the same time suggests there might be an underground current bringing them to the surface right now.</p>

<p>Looking at the different protest movements around the world, the common denominator that stands out is that they are all led by young people or that young people are the most militant group. The youthful spirit was often a factor in riots or revolutions in the past, but organization of persistent protests required more established powers such as labor unions or political parties to lead the way. Analysts have came up with a few reasons that might explain this, such as the spread of social media and fears about climate change, but economic anxiety appears to be the driving force.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Losing Your Ticket Into the Middle Class</h2>
<p>The global economy is locked in a situation which was never seen before in modern times. Many of the most powerful central banks in the world now offer historically low or even negative interest rates, in a way that distorts the normal economic functioning in areas beyond their control. Much has been written about the hazardous effects of this practice on investors and businesses, but negative rates are also detrimental to the lives of young people and how they perceive their chances of making a future for themselves.</p>
<p>The most obvious way this happens is by punishing people who want to plan for the future. Central banks hope that lower interest rates will push consumers to spend more, so this is not an unintended consequence, and as a result saving fiat money no longer makes sense. Young people understand that the value of any savings will only deteriorate, and in some cases be completely wiped out, by inflation. This is at the same time that banks will charge them interest on their debts. However, the most profound way low interest rates hurt young people is in its unintended consequence in the housing market.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-342014" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-1024x512.jpg" alt="Low Interest Rates Are Crushing Young People and Fueling Global Riots" width="696" height="348" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-1392x696.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya-840x420.jpg 840w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/catalunya.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></a></p>
<p>Buying property is the most common way people in previous generations have stored their wealth. In many countries, getting onto the property ladder is considered the ticket into the middle class and economists have warned that young people are postponing marriages and not having kids of their own due to not having the prospect of owning a home one day. People who have little to lose also have little to fear, and thus clashing with armed police or soldiers during riots is not as much of a deterrent as it is to older people with assets to lose.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise than that the young people of Hong Kong are the most persistent protesters so far, as the city has the world&rsquo;s most expensive housing market. In a place where a parking spot for your car costs almost US $1 million, now it is hard for people who need to be entering the workforce to imagine ever being able to stop paying the sky-high rent and finally buy a permanent home of their own. This is in sharp contrast to the older folks who only become more rich as the housing prices rise and thus much less likely to want to rock the boat.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, and with central bankers determined to keep lowering interest rates no matter the side effects on real-estate prices, riots can only be expected to spread further around the world. We can also expect to see more young people turn to radical ideas to change the economic status-quo that is crushing them, such as moving to a cryptocurrency-based system where those in power no longer have a monopoly on the flow of money.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">President Xi Urges Quick Development of Blockchain</h2>
<p>In his remarks to the participants in a group study session of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, the Chinese president &ldquo;underscored the important role of blockchain technology in the new round of technological innovation and industrial transformation, urging more efforts to quicken development in the sector.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a direct quote from a report by the state-run news agency Xinhua, which covered the meeting that took place this past Thursday.</p>
<p>Xi acknowledged that the application of blockchain technology has been extended to multiple sectors of the economy, including digital finance, Internet of Things, smart manufacturing, supply chain management, and digital asset trading. He also pointed out that the world&rsquo;s major powers are stepping up efforts in planning blockchain technology development. China&rsquo;s blockchain sector has a sound foundation, the leader noted, emphasizing the need to expedite the development of blockchain technology and innovation-driven industrial development.</p>

<p>China must gain an edge in this field, the statesman said, in its theories and in its industries, he elaborated. But to achieve that, more efforts should be made in order to strengthen the basic research conducted in the most populous country and to boost innovation in one of the oldest nations. The accomplishment of that goal lies in the advancement of &ldquo;coordinated key-task tackling&rdquo; and the acceleration of &ldquo;breakthroughs in key technologies.&rdquo; These should provide &ldquo;safe and controllable technological support for blockchain development and its application,&rdquo; Xi added.</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Republic has to increase its influence and rule-making power in the global arena and its president believes this could happen through stepping up research on the standardization of blockchain and its deep integration with other information technologies, the digital economy, and the real economy in general. Submitting a number of demands for the implementation of blockchain in multiple spheres of the Chinese society, government and economy, Xi finally stressed how essential it is to make sure that the technology plays a bigger role in building China&rsquo;s strength in the cyberspace and ultimately advancing the country&rsquo;s economic and social development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">China&rsquo;s Influence in the World Grows</h2>
<p>China is now an important geopolitical factor and any comments made by its head of state do matter. Beijing holds $1.11 trillion of U.S. debt as of May this year, while the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkey-throws-another-wrench-into-the-usds-works-and-joins-russian-swift/">dollar</a> is still the world&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/why-the-birth-of-bitcoin-can-be-traced-back-to-1971/">reserve currency</a> facilitating global trade. Some analysts believe China will be the next leading superpower, economically at least, and if it succeeds in overtaking the American economy, its national fiat, the renminbi could become the new global reserve currency. To achieve that, however, Beijing needs to address a number of issues. First of all, many, especially in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/currency-war-erupts-as-us-and-china-bring-out-the-big-guns/">United States</a>, would point out that the RMB is artificially undervalued to help bolster Chinese exports.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-342875 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1439407712.jpg" alt="Is China&rsquo;s New Fascination With Blockchain Really Good for Bitcoin?" width="1000" height="509" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1439407712.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1439407712-300x153.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1439407712-768x391.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1439407712-696x354.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1439407712-825x420.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Then China has its own set of economic and financial problems, not very different from the West&rsquo;s. The country&rsquo;s banking system is currently facing debt and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liquidity-difficulties-in-china-second-bank-bail-out-now-reality/">liquidity issues</a> affecting dozens of small lenders, with the first bank collapse caused by these problems recorded earlier this year. The People&rsquo;s Bank of China is pushing hard for its version of quantitative easing, trying to convince commercial banks to seek recapitalization through the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetualbond.asp">perpetual-bond</a> market. A &ldquo;digital yuan&rdquo; has been in the making, with the PBoC recently hiring six crypto experts to work on its development, but make no mistake &ndash; this yuan will be just as fiat as the paper one or the greenback.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s importance has been growing in the crypto space as well. Some of the industry&rsquo;s most prominent platforms, leading crypto exchange <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a> for example, have their roots in the People&rsquo;s Republic. Unfortunately, the government in Beijing is not a supporter of decentralized currencies and has effectively banned crypto <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">trading platforms</a> and coin offering projects from the mainland. Blockchain without Bitcoin, however, is merely a smart way to build databases. China&rsquo;s new focus on the technology, as an end in itself, will hardly bring any long term good to permissionless cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, Xinhua&rsquo;s report about Xi&rsquo;s endorsement of blockchain was quickly followed by a sudden spike of prices across crypto markets. Call it a coincidence if you wish, but many think it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>China is also a pronounced leader in bitcoin mining, thanks to cheap and abundant electrical energy and suitable climatic conditions in some of its regions. Chinese mining pools control over 70% of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> network&rsquo;s hashrate. The Asian country manufactures the bulk of the mining equipment sold today with Beijing-based <a href="bitmain.com">Bitmain</a> being the leading producer of specialized hardware. China hasn&rsquo;t yet implemented an official ban on cryptocurrencies and has been turning a blind eye to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-big-hydro-power-partners-with-bitcoin-miners-to-prevent-energy-waste/">mining</a>, but what if one day Politburo decides <a href="https://buy.bitcoin.com/">permissionless currencies</a> are not good for the Chinese people and pulls the plug on Chinese miners because they consume a lot of electricity?</p>

<p>House sparrows were once declared public enemy number one in the People&rsquo;s Republic. Killing as many of them as possible was set as a priority during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign">Four Pests Campaign</a> in the &lsquo;50s and &lsquo;60s. A single bird can steal four pounds of grain per year from the hungry Chinese workers and peasants, the communist government estimated. However, once the sparrow population was severely depleted, grasshoppers swarmed the countryside in the absence of their natural predator. Taking out an element deeply integrated into the ecosystem ultimately caused more people to starve in what became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">Great Chinese Famine</a>.</p>

Local reports detail a few banking establishments have been burned after customers started having issues withdrawing cash from ATMs. Issues with the bank machines that don&rsquo;t work coupled with rising inflation, pension cuts, and austerity measures have invoked Chileans to rise up and take to the streets in protest against their government.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">State of Unrest in Chile Sees Government Violence and People Unable to Access Cash at ATMs</h2>
<p>Chile has been getting a lot of attention lately because the region&rsquo;s citizens have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-demand-for-permissionless-freedom-is-just-getting-started/">clashed</a> against the authorities, shaking the country to the core. More than half of Chile&rsquo;s 16 state regions are locked down under &ldquo;emergency orders&rdquo; and must obey a <a href="https://twitter.com/PumpkinToshi/status/1186362662013288449">military-backed curfew</a>. It all started when the government-run subway operation Metro de Santiago increased the price of metro tickets to roughly $1.15. To make matters worse, public pensions are unsustainable even though its creator Jos&eacute; Pi&ntilde;era <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/08/chile-tinkers-with-its-ground-breaking-pensions-system">calls</a> Chile&rsquo;s pension framework the &ldquo;Mercedes-Benz&rdquo; of infrastructure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-342821" title="Cash Runs Dry at ATMs as Protests Escalate in Chile" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhsjjdjjdj.jpg" alt="Cash Runs Dry at ATMs as Protests Escalate in Chile" width="508" height="286" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhsjjdjjdj.jpg 640w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhsjjdjjdj-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px"></p>
<p>Pensions are being cut or not being paid and to top it off Chile&rsquo;s bureaucracy increased electrical costs in the country by 10%. After the hike in metro ticket fares, students started hopping the station&rsquo;s turnstile every day in protest. Marta Lagos, an executive from the polling company Latinobarometro says the last few decades of politicians have sparked the unrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The students jumped the turnstiles, and as it happens in revolutions, the elements that trigger a social phenomenon are not very rational,&rdquo; Lagos <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/death-toll-rises-to-15-from-chilean-protest-clashes">said</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just this government &mdash; This has been accumulating in the last four governments.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-342824 size-full" title="Cash Runs Dry at ATMs as Protests Escalate in Chile" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kkkjfjjfjjdjskskkd.jpg" alt="Cash Runs Dry at ATMs as Protests Escalate in Chile" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kkkjfjjfjjdjskskkd.jpg 640w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kkkjfjjfjjdjskskkd-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chileans Have Access to Tools That Can Strengthen Financial Inclusion</h2>
<p>During the last two weeks, the situation in Chile has escalated and according to various regional reports, the military has been extremely violent toward protesters. One person who has a friend from Chile <a href="https://twitter.com/PumpkinToshi/status/1186341968210644992">writes</a>: &ldquo;The Chilean government is murdering innocent people on the streets, I have a friend in Chile &mdash; She said she has no access to money and they&rsquo;ve closed all of the supermarkets, ATMs are locked. This is who we are up against &mdash; People are getting mass murdered by the government.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just wow.</p>
<p>This is Chile today.</p>
<p>But one million people marching in the street isn&rsquo;t newsworthy to the Western media when they&rsquo;re protesting against a corrupt, US-backed regime I guess. &#129303; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChileProtests?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ChileProtests</a> <a href="https://t.co/vDZ4fiLzsR">pic.twitter.com/vDZ4fiLzsR</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are various reports throughout the weekend <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/death-toll-rises-to-15-from-chilean-protest-clashes">backing up the claim</a> that ATMs are not operational and people are having issues accessing their funds. Supermarkets are also running out of food and the Chilean people have seen food shortages in certain districts.</p>

<p>Without being able to access cash, Chilean residents have resorted to barter and the use of cryptocurrencies. There are <a href="https://local.bitcoin.com/offers/Chile">traders in Chile</a> who are buying and selling bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) using bank transfers and gift cards via <a href="https://local.bitcoin.com/">local.Bitcoin.com</a>. The platform is a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows users from around the world to buy and sell bitcoin cash in a noncustodial fashion. Governments have been committing crimes against peaceful citizens worldwide and with massive protests in Argentina, Venezuela, Hong Kong, France, and Lebanon, people are finding the benefits of borderless and permissionless electronic cash.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies allow people to access their hard-earned funds when they want to without a state-run financial institution stopping them. The path toward freedom in Chile will not be found solely in cryptocurrencies, but Chileans can use them as a tool to bypass ridiculous restrictions. Platforms and marketplaces like <a href="https://local.bitcoin.com/">local.Bitcoin.com</a> will be there to help spread the effort for economic freedom, not only in Chile but on a global level.</p>

This month, up until the mainnet launch, Coinex is in the midst of its pre-election process with new node participants preparing to partner with the Coinex Chain ecosystem. To further promote decentralized innovation, Bitcoin.com has joined the Coinex Chain network by planning to run a validator node on the blockchain.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Global Participants Join the Coinex Chain Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Since the inception of Bitcoin and various alternative digital assets, centralized exchanges have lost customer funds every single year. Exchanges like Bitfinex, Mt. Gox, and Bithumb have lost millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies. The trading platform and blockchain business <a href="https://www.coinex.com">Coinex</a> wants to tackle this problem with a <a href="https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/what-is-a-dex/">dex chain</a> that bypasses single points of failure and censorship while also providing a transparent process. Essentially, Coinex has created a distributed ledger system that allows for decentralized exchange functions, onchain privacy protection, and the ability to make programmable cash a reality.</p>

<p>In addition to the dex functionality, <a href="https://www.coinex.org/?lang=en_US">Coinex Chain</a> aims to provide anyone with the means to issue a token and trade tokens onchain noncustodially. Users will participate in a governance system that allows for more transparency and user-base decision-making. Coinex Chain users will also be able to leverage the framework to issue pegged tokens and digitized assets.</p>

<p>The Coinex Chain Foundation held an event in Shenzhen, China on Oct 16 and started the Coinex Chain <a href="https://announcement.coinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035139051">pre-election process</a>. The conference was an important event for Coinex as global validator nodes <a href="https://www.coinex.com/activity/node-vote">joined the ecosystem</a>. Blockchain startups participating include Rockx, Ifwallet, CETDAC, Seele Ecosystem, and Realmx. Being proponents of a strong cryptocurrency-powered future, Bitcoin.com has <a href="http://47.244.44.205/validator/cettestvaloper1ngd0ypqq0fzpye9p2a935vkq2v06rfzvj0yg8v">joined</a> the validator node process as well. Right now there are 31 participants and approximately 1,073,220,442 votes in the pre-election. The <a href="https://www.coinex.com/activity/node-vote">pre-election event</a> running until November aims to provide users with the node election scheme before the official election begins. Coinex users can vote in the pre-election and they will be able to win prizes worth 150,000,000 CET.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Aiming to Build a Transparent, Secure, and Permissionless Financial Platform</h2>
<p>The firm wholeheartedly believes the <a href="https://www.coinex.org/?lang=en_US">Coinex Chain</a> system of three public blockchains tethered to the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) will cushion decentralized exchange functions, smart contracts and decision-based transaction tasks, and privacy methods that reinforce cryptocurrency confidentiality. &ldquo;With functions such as asset-mapping, onchain trading and onchain matching, the dex public chain can address the problems of centralized exchanges, such as poor safety and intransparency that have been widely criticized,&rdquo; explains the <a href="https://www.coinex.org/whitepaper_en.pdf">Coinex Chain whitepaper</a>. &ldquo;[The goal is to return] asset control to users, provide an order-book based on a fair onchain matching algorithm, permissionless onchain listing and creating trading pairs.&rdquo; The white paper adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>All of these efforts are aimed to build a transparent, secure, and permissionless financial platform for free trading. At the same time, features such as high TPS (transactions per second) performance and second-level transaction confirmation provided by the underlying Tendermint Consensus can maximumly restore the user experience like that in centralized exchanges.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>With participants like <a href="http://47.244.44.205/validator/cettestvaloper1ngd0ypqq0fzpye9p2a935vkq2v06rfzvj0yg8v">Bitcoin.com joining the pre-election process</a>, the testnet launch has been very successful. The Coinex Foundation plans to continue showcasing the project worldwide in regions like Hong Kong, Singapore, Wuzhen, and Beijing. The core Coinex Chain engineers such as the project&rsquo;s lead developer, Jiazhi Jiang, have been introducing the platform during the company&rsquo;s world tour. After the three-chain system initiates the mainnet launch, in the future, Coinex will build more application-specific public chains in order to help strengthen the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.
