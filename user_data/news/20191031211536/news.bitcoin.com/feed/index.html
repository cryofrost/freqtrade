<h2 style="text-align: center;">The 11th Anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper</h2>
<p>11 years ago today, at 2:10 p.m. Eastern Standard, Satoshi Nakamoto published the <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> to the Cryptography Mailing List. The service used was a pipermail message service hosted on metzdowd.com run by a group of cypherpunks. The mailing list message title was called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper</a>&rdquo; and Nakamoto explained that he had been &ldquo;working on a new electronic cash system that&rsquo;s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.&rdquo; The anonymous creator also revealed that the paper was hosted on the website bitcoin.org.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343723" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343723 size-full" title="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg.jpg" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" width="1500" height="450" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-300x90.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-768x230.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1024x307.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-696x209.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1392x418.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1068x320.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1400x420.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343723" class="wp-caption-text">The first group of people Satoshi showed his project to were the cypherpunks using the Cryptography Mailing List hosted on metzdowd.com.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nakamoto emphasized in his email that the main property of the protocol was that &ldquo;double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.&rdquo; He highlighted that there was no mint or trusted third parties and &ldquo;participants can be anonymous&rdquo; if they choose to be. The first email detailed that &ldquo;new coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work and the proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the network to prevent double-spending.&rdquo;</p>
<figure id="attachment_343720" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343720" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343720 size-full" title="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump.jpg" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" width="1500" height="900" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-300x180.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-768x461.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-696x418.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-1392x835.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-700x420.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343720" class="wp-caption-text">On the eve of Halloween on October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper for the first time. More than a decade later there are 3,000+ digital currencies in existence following Bitcoin&rsquo;s initial launch.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Bitcoin whitepaper announcement wasn&rsquo;t a huge deal at the time and really only a small number of people witnessed the message and replied. So three days later on November 3, 2008, he decided to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014815.html">write the mailing list again</a> pitching the newly published paper. The Bitcoin inventor mentioned some of the same things that were said in the previous message published on Halloween. A few people had replied to Satoshi at the time and one individual seemed to like the idea, but he didn&rsquo;t think Bitcoin could scale. Nakamoto dismissed the scaling issue casually and said: &ldquo;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.&rdquo; Nakamoto continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;P2P Networks Seem to Be Holding Their Own&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Nakamoto also mentioned concepts like Moore&rsquo;s Law and told the person that it would take several years for the network to grow extremely massive and &ldquo;by then, sending 2 HD movies over the internet would probably not seem like a big deal.&rdquo; The same day, Nakamoto <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014818.html">replied</a> again in regard to a few attack theories that could be associated with dishonest nodes. Again being the master of his craft, Nakamoto quickly replied and explained that if a &ldquo;bad guy does overpower the network&rdquo; the miner would have to outpace the system and it would be much like &ldquo;bouncing a check.&rdquo; &ldquo;To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back. I don&rsquo;t think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins,&rdquo; Nakamoto stressed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343717" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343717 size-full" title="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1.jpg" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" width="1500" height="750" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-1392x696.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343717" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">If you haven&rsquo;t read the Bitcoin whitepaper you can read it here.</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>More than a decade later, the Bitcoin network and the cryptocurrency ecosystem have grown massive. There are more than <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">3,000 digital currencies</a> listed on market capitalization websites and there&rsquo;s roughly a quarter of a trillion dollars in digital currency value being held by people worldwide. Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s paper and the network that went online the following January created a system of wealth that transcends borders, governments, and corporate control. Nakamoto highlighted two days after his third email that Bitcoin was merely an efficient tool and it wasn&rsquo;t the cure-all against the <a href="https://www.mensenrechten.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-most-dangerous-superstition-larken-rose-20111.pdf">monopolistic system of force</a> that still exists in society today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,&rdquo; Nakamoto <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014823.html">remarked</a> on November 6. &ldquo;But we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far his forecast has been true and Bitcoin has ushered in a new form of money and a taste of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire">true laissez-faire</a>. People have been able to use bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to bypass state laws, sanctions, capital controls, and help people who need funds without restrictions. Since the birth of cryptographic currency, many other ideas have stemmed from the technological innovation and people are focused on building platforms like decentralized exchanges and concepts that utilize zero-knowledge proofs. The 11th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper reminds people how powerful Nakamoto&rsquo;s invention still is to this day and how it continues to transform the world of finance as we know it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Presidential Committee Pushes for Crypto Legalization</h2>
<p>The South Korean Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (PCFIR), directly under the president, has made several recommendations regarding the country&rsquo;s cryptocurrency regulation. The PCFIR coordinates policies and reviews matters pertaining to the national master plans and strategies related to the &ldquo;fourth industrial revolution,&rdquo; which refers to a highly connected economy supported by advances in areas such as blockchain, 5G, artificial intelligence, big data, and the internet of things.</p>
<p>At the committee&rsquo;s global policy conference in Seoul on Oct. 25, PCFIR Chairman Chang Byung-gyu said &ldquo;the government needs to establish the legal status of crypto assets,&rdquo; several local media outlets quoted him as saying.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343591" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343591" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343591 size-full" title="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee.jpg" alt="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343591" class="wp-caption-text">The Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution at its Oct. 25 global policy conference.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Emphasizing that the country&rsquo;s regulations and administrative procedures must be improved to foster innovative startups, Chang stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The legal status of crypto assets should be established as soon as possible, and tax and accounting measures should be taken.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Call for Changes Under New FSC Chairman</h2>
<p>The committee also urged the government to promote innovation and the institutionalization of crypto assets in order to stay competitive globally. However, so far, the government has opposed the idea due to concerns of possible side effects raised by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Information, an industry stakeholder told MSN news outlet.</p>
<p>The PCFIR criticized the government&rsquo;s current crypto policies of focusing primarily on curbing speculation and reducing the kimchi premium, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The government&rsquo;s deterrence policy, which is indispensable to the cryptocurrency speculation fever, is reducing our global competitiveness in the blockchain and crypto-asset industries &hellip; We need to set policy goals to preempt future opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Led by former chairman Choi Jong-ku, South Korea&rsquo;s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) implemented emergency cryptocurrency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-emergency-cryptocurrency-regulation/">measures</a> in December 2017 in order to curb the kimchi premium. Several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-releases-official-guidelines-cryptocurrency-exchanges-banks/">follow-up measures</a> were introduced over the next few months, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-ends-anonymous-cryptocurrency-trading/">real-name system</a> in January last year. However, only the country&rsquo;s top four crypto exchanges have been able to use the system so far.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343594" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343594" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343594 size-full" title="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo.jpg" alt="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343594" class="wp-caption-text">New FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Choi is no longer the chairman of the FSC. He was succeeded by Eun Sung-soo on Sept. 9. Prior to his appointment, Eun served as the president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of Korea and led the Korea Investment Corporation, Korea&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, from January 2016 to September 2017.</p>
<p>After the PCFIR announced its crypto recommendations, Lee Kong-joo, Advisor to the President for Science and Technology, thanked the committee for its efforts, the Bchain publication detailed, quoting him as saying, &ldquo;I will actively consider ways to make these [recommendations] possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hankyoreh reported on Oct. 27 that the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, under the FSC&rsquo;s supervision, said that it will beef up crypto regulations in compliance with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The announcement followed a recent FATF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-starts-checking-how-well-countries-implement-crypto-standards/">plenary meeting</a>. The FATF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-global-standards-crypto-assets/">issued guidance</a> on crypto assets and related service providers in June and is currently evaluating how well its member countries are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-starts-checking-how-well-countries-implement-crypto-standards/">applying the guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">You Can Now Get Paid With Bitcoin Cash</h2>
<p>International cryptocurrency payroll and human resources service provider <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-companies-can-now-settle-payroll-taxes-in-cryptocurrency-via-bitwage/">Bitwage</a> has recently announced the launch of bitcoin cash payrolls. This means that anyone working for a U.S., EU or U.K. employer can now receive a portion of their wage in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> by signing up to the service. Companies can also sign up to fund payrolls in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> or to offer <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> to their employees and freelancers.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-343616" title="US, EU and UK Companies Can Now Pay Workers in Bitcoin Cash via Bitwage" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1024x512.jpg" alt="US, EU and UK Companies Can Now Pay Workers in Bitcoin Cash via Bitwage" width="696" height="348" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1392x696.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-840x420.jpg 840w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></a></p>
<p>Earlier this year the company expanded beyond just <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> by launching support for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> payrolls. Shortly after that it took a customer survey to learn what else its users wanted and discovered that there was demand more cryptocurrency payment options. Bitcoin cash, as a consistent top four digital asset, offering low fees and fast transactions, was a natural choice to add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, employees and freelancers are looking to diversify their portfolio of cryptocurrency,&rdquo; <a href="https://blog.bitwage.com/2019/10/29/bitwage-launches-bitcoin-cash-payrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> Bitwage CEO Jonathan Chester. &ldquo;Bitwage is making it easier for workers around the world to accumulate their favorite cryptocurrency, through passive dollar-cost-averaging.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitwage Is Used by Workers at Facebook, Google and Uber</h2>
<p>Bitwage has been providing direct bitcoin deposits since 2014, and reportedly already serves over 30,000 people including employees, freelancers and independent contractors. It has also reportedly raised around $1 million in total funding from a number of investors such as Draper Associates, Orange and BPI France.</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s website, the service has been used by workers of Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, American Express, GE, Comcast and other corporations as well as public institutions such as the World Health Organization. Coinciding with the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> launch, Bitcoin.com has now onboarded as an initial customer, Bitwage revealed.</p>

Of course, the reality is that China&rsquo;s marked shift towards pro-blockchain policies is part of a much wider trend which has seen Asian multinationals and governments embrace the considerable potential of distributed ledger technologies.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Two-Year Turnaround</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Xi&rsquo;s announcement centered on the creation of a state-backed digital currency (a stablecoin tied to the renminbi), an idea which has been gestating since the country&rsquo;s central bank started exploring the possibility as far back as 2014. With the dawn of a new decade, a law will come into effect on January 1 with the aim of &ldquo;facilitating the development of the cryptography business and ensuring the security of cyberspace and information.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-326109" title="The Xi Effect &ndash; Chinese Government to Fund Blockchain Projects" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china.png" alt="The Xi Effect &ndash; Chinese Government to Fund Blockchain Projects" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china.png 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-300x150.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-768x384.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-696x348.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-840x420.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is predicted that the currency in question will launch soon after, although perhaps the possibility of blockchain technologies powering the continued transformation of China&rsquo;s vast industries is of greater significance. Xi specifically mentioned that the technology could be applied to realms including finance, public services, employment, education and infrastructure management. It&rsquo;s all a far cry from 2017, when the government imposed a general ban on all crypto businesses and exchanges. From deep suspicion, to a state-supervised (albeit heavily surveilled) cryptocurrency, in just two years is quite a turnaround.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after the announcement was made, the local government of Guangzhou announced</span><a href="https://newslogical.com/chinese-local-government-to-release-150m-blockchain-project-fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a $150 million fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for outstanding blockchain projects, with more initiatives expected in the near future. </span></p>

On the markets, some of this week&rsquo;s biggest beneficiaries have been Chinese blockchains, even if there&rsquo;s nothing to suggest they&rsquo;re due to receive an influx of fresh business from government enterprises. In fact, six of the seven best-performing crypto assets in the top 50 this week have Chinese origins.

As well as facilitating the creation of decentralized applications (dapps) running on the Tron ecosystem, the Keystore will let users access and trade <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a> directly from the wallet on their handset. Perhaps coincidentally, industry sources are mulling over rumours that Samsung is </span><a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2019/10/133_277813.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsourcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a part of its smartphone manufacturing to China.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung has been experimenting with blockchain technologies for some time now, and with their growing dapp arsenal, their long-term strategy seems positively crypto-centric. It isn&rsquo;t the only smartphone company testing the blockchain waters either; Taiwanese electronics giant HTC has also invested heavily in decentralized services and a blockchain-powered handset, the Exodus 1, and its successor, the 1s, which can run a full Bitcoin node.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Next for China?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term effect of China&rsquo;s increasingly pro-blockchain outlook remains to be seen, and until its state cryptocurrency is hatched and various policies put into action, we won&rsquo;t be able to quantify the consequences for blockchain technology and digital currencies more generally. That said, interest in the region is largely unrelated to the President&rsquo;s ringing endorsement; according to a report by the Financial Times, Chinese companies have filed more patents on blockchain than companies from any other region in the world. A significant percentage of bitcoin mining is concentrated in the region, and many of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges are either based or were founded in the Asian continent, from Beijing and Singapore to Hong Kong and Tokyo. Regardless of its real ramifications, Asian crypto companies were never going to let President Xi&rsquo;s decree go to waste.</span></p>

Every day we would hear about a new venture that supposedly signed a partnership with a global brand such as Microsoft or Google, to make us think that these tech giants were backing the idea. In reality most of the time it was just a trivial matter such as allowing the project to use free services from the tech giant, as countless other startups do. The tactic is still used today and crypto investors need to keep in mind that it is not a guarantee for success. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Big Name Pumping</h2>
<p>As if crypto investors have learned nothing over the past few years, some project promoters continue to try and push their tokens with announcements about big name partnerships. These normal business agreements can be used sometimes to hint, insinuate or even predict a price rise of a related token in an irresponsible way. Companies and startups make a lot of agreements to cooperate with one another and these are not a guarantee of a deal that will bring in more money or users.</p>
<p>Additionally, doing so isn&rsquo;t just potentially misleading to investors &ndash; it can also be very detrimental to the projects themselves. Authorities around the world such as the U.S. SEC and Chinese financial regulators are actively seeking to make examples out of ICOs and crypto ventures to tarnish the whole industry as promoting unregistered securities. Making grandiose partnership statements with the intended purpose of pumping a token is providing them with ammunition.</p>

Last week he tweeted about a deal with a hundred billion dollar &ldquo;mega corporation&rdquo; that will &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; the native tokens of Tron, Bittorrent and Wink. Many traders indeed responded positively to the news by buying the coins, despite widespread cynicism on crypto forums about all the previous hype from the Tron founder. On Tuesday he revealed that the company&rsquo;s blockchain is now integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore SDK, meaning that smartphone app developers can build services running on the system like they already can with its main competitor, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">High Profile Partnerships Are No Guarantee for Success</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors need to keep in mind that all ventures in this ecosystem are highly risky investments and there is no certainty that the ICO token or other digital asset you invested in will be still valuable in two or three years. The absolute majority of technological startups in all fields don&rsquo;t survive, with venture capital industry estimates of over 90% failure rate.</p>
<p>This can be despite having a smart team, brilliant idea or great technological innovation. At the end of the day, what matters for all businesses is if you can get enough paying costumers to cover the bills and make a profit. Without this you are just burning investors&rsquo; money until further investment comes in or you have to shut down. Partnerships that don&rsquo;t bring in new money or paying clients won&rsquo;t change that.</p>

<p>In the digital assets field in particular, with the lingering effects of crypto winter, many projects that once seemed promising are these days find themselves forced to shut down. A recent example of this is Platin, a secure Proof of Location protocol which incentivizes nodes at scale by means of its own blockchain-based token. On Monday the team announced on <a href="https://medium.com/@platin_io/a-letter-to-the-platin-community-9cb603b3d0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a> that the company will be shutting down on November 1, 2019, after which all services will no longer be available. This is despite all the recognition from big names it got over the last two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Japan noticed as Platin was selected by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as one of the world&rsquo;s leading blockchain innovations. Germany noticed as its Startup Autobahn selected Platin to showcase proof of location to Mercedes Benz, Rolls Royce, Porsche and other automotive giants,&rdquo; the final letter from the team recounted. &ldquo;IBM noticed as it selected Platin for its AlphaZONE technology accelerator. The European Space agency noticed as they admitted Platin to the Galileo Positioning System Task Force. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a> and Block.one noticed as they invested in Platin and showcased our technology on the world stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, at the end the founders explained that &ldquo;One of the biggest challenges we faced was how to continue pushing forward while our resources were dwindling and turbulent market forces weren&rsquo;t providing a stable environment in which to operate. We did everything in our power to extend Platin&rsquo;s operations as far as we could, month after month, continually bootstrapping in the face of great uncertainty. In addition to developing Platin&rsquo;s visionary technologies, we worked hard every day to secure the next round of funding, which always seemed to be just around the corner. Unfortunately, we weren&rsquo;t able to get there in time.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitmain Secretly Files for U.S. Initial Public Offering</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently has two mining manufacturers to approve for IPO status in the country. According to <a href="http://www.sycaijing.com/news/details?id=74991&type=0">Tencent News</a>, the IPO is sponsored by the financial giant Deutsche Bank and it was filed at roughly the same time Canaan Creative <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/avalon-mining-rig-maker-canaan-files-for-400m-ipo-on-nasdaq/">filed</a> for its IPO earlier this week. Canaan the makers of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/manufacturing-giants-bitmain-and-canaan-announce-second-generation-miners/">Avalon mining rigs</a> and chips filed for a $400 million IPO on Nasdaq but the Bitmain valuation is currently unknown. Tencent&rsquo;s (sycaijing.com) translated editorial details that Bitmain has hired China-based executive Zheng Hua who once worked with Nasdaq, so there&rsquo;s a chance the company&rsquo;s filing is similar to Canaan&rsquo;s filing as far as listing status.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343461" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343461 size-full" title="Mining Giant Bitmain Confidentially Files for U.S.-Based IPO" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitmainhhdhdhhdhdh.jpg" alt="Mining Giant Bitmain Confidentially Files for U.S.-Based IPO" width="1000" height="400" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitmainhhdhdhhdhdh.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitmainhhdhdhhdhdh-300x120.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitmainhhdhdhhdhdh-768x307.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitmainhhdhdhhdhdh-696x278.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343461" class="wp-caption-text">Mining chip and device manufacturer Bitmain has filed with the SEC for an IPO in the U.S.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The news follows Bitmain&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmain-aims-to-build-a-300mw-texas-mining-farm/">recent push</a> in Rockdale, Texas where the firm is building a bitcoin mine with up to 300 megawatts (MW) of hashpower. So far the facility houses 25MW and another 25MW will come online soon according to Bitmain. Last year, the company also filed an IPO prospectus in Hong Kong in order to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE). However, in March 2019 the Chinese mining giant let the application lapse and did not file another IPO prospectus in the country. Canaan also filed an IPO in Hong Kong and let the application slide as well. Confidential or &lsquo;secret&rsquo; IPO filings are not uncommon in the U.S. as the SEC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/30/sec-to-allow-all-companies-to-file-secretly-for-ipos.html">approved</a> such filings in June 2017.</p>

<p>Additionally, Bitmain has released and shipped a wide variety of next-generation bitcoin core (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) miners this year. Despite the FUD last year, the company has managed to produce at least <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/manufacturing-giants-bitmain-and-canaan-announce-second-generation-miners/">10 new machines</a> including a special edition <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmain-launches-low-cost-special-edition-antminer-s9/">S9 Antminer</a>. According to <a href="https://www.asicminervalue.com">Asicminervalue.com</a>, while filtering SHA256 miners specifically, the company&rsquo;s S17 series rigs are the top two bitcoin miners today just above Innosilicon&rsquo;s T3. The S17 series Antminers produce a whopping 50+ terahash per second (TH/s) and the firm&rsquo;s machines coming in December will generate 70+TH/s according to specifications. Machines have been delivered even though there have been rumors of a <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3081702/tsmc-7nm-delay-blight-amd-ryzen-navi-production">7nm shortage</a> at the semiconductor foundries since the last two Samsung and iPhone launches.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cofounder Ousted</h2>
<p>The IPO filing news also developed after the recent headlines that said Micree Ketuan Zhan, the cofounder of Bitmain, was ousted. Leaked <a href="https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1189038548281745410">reports</a> disclosed that Bitmain cofounder Jihan Wu disagreed with Zhan in regard to the artificial intelligence (AI) chip production which is allegedly floundering. Wu has reportedly taken over the head leadership position at the company and Zhan&rsquo;s dismissal was &ldquo;effective immediately&rdquo; and includes &ldquo;all roles&rdquo; at the firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitmain&rsquo;s co-founder, chairman, legal representative, and executive director Jihan Wu has decided to dismiss all roles of Ketuan Zhan, effective immediately,&rdquo; a circulating email disclosed. &ldquo;Any Bitmain staff shall no longer take any direction from Zhan, or participate in any meeting organized by Zhan. Bitmain may, based on the situation, consider terminating employment contracts of those who violate this note.&rdquo; Since the Bitmain management shake-up, the price of bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) rose by double digits on October 29.</p>

The question isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;why did Satoshi disappear?&rsquo; but rather &lsquo;why then?&rsquo; Was Satoshi&rsquo;s departure in early 2011 scheduled long in advance, or did unforeseen events compel Nakamoto to pack his bags and flee the community he had founded, never to return? Several credible theories abound.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Theory 1: It Was Planned All Along</h2>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto was a methodical and meticulous man. That much we can ascertain from his writings. He doesn&rsquo;t seem the sort to wake up one morning and YOLO his way out of the community he created. Knowing there would be no coming back once he&rsquo;d made the decision to leave, Satoshi may have had his departure scheduled months or even years in advance, and worked diligently to that deadline. If so, it would explain why his <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2228.msg29479#msg29479">last forum post</a> was a typically business-like despatch, leaving parting instructions on what had been remedied in build 0.3.19 of Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70497" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_292855712.jpg" alt="Julian Assange Thanks U.S. Government for 50,000% Gains on Wikileaks' Bitcoin Holdings" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_292855712.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_292855712-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_292855712-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_292855712-696x464.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_292855712-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Theory 2: It Was Wikileaks</h2>
<p>Satoshi tended to keep his emotions in check when <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/">posting</a> on the Bitcointalk forum. He had the air of a man who knew he had a lot to do and a short time in which to do it, and thus refrained from shitposting or shooting the breeze. He could occasionally be brusque (&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me or don&rsquo;t get it, I don&rsquo;t have time to try to convince you, sorry&rdquo;), but was never rude or prone to venting. His penultimate forum post, however, portrays a twinge of annoyance.</p>
<p>In response to a PC World <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/213230/could_wikileaks_scandal_lead_to_new_virtual_currency.html">article</a> commenting on Wikileaks&rsquo; adoption of bitcoin to circumvent its financial blockade, Satoshi famously <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.msg29280#msg29280">wrote</a>: &ldquo;It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet&rsquo;s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.&rdquo; Could Wikileaks thrusting Bitcoin and its enigmatic creator into the spotlight have been the last straw that sent Satoshi scurrying for cover? The argument that Bitcoin was getting too big too fast, which expedited Satoshi&rsquo;s departure, seems credible.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Theory 3: It Was the CIA</h2>
<p>Satoshi&rsquo;s final correspondence, from an April 26, 2011 <a href="https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshis-final-email-to-gavin-andresen/">email</a> to Gavin Andresen, has given rise to another theory as to why he abruptly left. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors; it helps motivate them.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Gavin replied, he informed Satoshi that he had been invited to speak at an event hosted by an organization under the CIA. Satoshi never replied. Did the mention of spooks spook Satoshi?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Theory 4: It Was Personal</h2>
<p>We know nothing about Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s personal life. It is quite possible that his exodus was triggered by events that he could never have publicly communicated. Failing health, injury or new responsibilities (family, professional, personal) could have forced Satoshi&rsquo;s hand, compelling him to bow out earlier than anticipated. If that were the case, we&rsquo;d have no way of knowing. To this day, there are many who believe Satoshi is no longer with us because he is no longer alive.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94617" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/genesis-block-creation.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/genesis-block-creation.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/genesis-block-creation-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/genesis-block-creation-768x432.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/genesis-block-creation-696x392.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/genesis-block-creation-746x420.jpg 746w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Theory 5: It Was Symbolic</h2>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto and the birth of Bitcoin is a saga shrouded in symbology that reads like a Dan Brown novel for cypherpunks. From the name assigned to the genesis block to the sudden disappearance of its creator, it&rsquo;s hard to avoid the religious undertones. Aside from its name, there is the oddity of the genesis block taking six days to mine. As speculated in an old Bitcointalk <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.0">forum thread</a>, this may have been an easter egg left by Satoshi in homage to the biblical account of creation. As Genesis 2:2 recounts: &ldquo;And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those interested in ascribing symbology to Satoshi&rsquo;s actions, there&rsquo;s more. Christ&rsquo;s ministry on earth is believed to have lasted for around three years. Satoshi&rsquo;s first known contact with the world occurred on August 22, 2008, in an <a href="https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshi-and-wei-dai-correspondence/">email</a> to b-money creator Wei Dai, though he is <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/674532412408225792">believed</a> to have reached out to Adam Back before that. Satoshi&rsquo;s final verified <a href="https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshis-final-email-to-gavin-andresen/">email</a> was to Gavin Andresen on April 26, 2011, meaning that his ministry also lasted for around three years.</p>
<p>The fact that Satoshi&rsquo;s teachings have been subject to extensive interpretation and misinterpretation in the years since, while his disciples await the second coming of Bitcoin&rsquo;s creator, has further solidified the parallels with Christ. Satoshi wasn&rsquo;t perfect &ndash; his code tells us that much &ndash; and common sense tells us that putting fallible men on pedestals is the antithesis of everything Bitcoin stands for. It is possible to be opposed to leadership cults, however, while also assigning messianic qualities to the life and times of Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>There is evidence, incidentally, that Satoshi was tiring of the cult that was beginning to form around him; the PC World article on Wikileaks he took exception to claimed that &ldquo;Bitcoin is the creation of Japanese programmer Satoshi Nakamoto,&rdquo; while in his final email to Gavin Andresen he complained &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure &hellip; Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors.&rdquo; Satoshi had no interest in becoming a living legend and overshadowing his magnum opus.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Theory 6: Bitcoin Was Ready</h2>
<p>According to the gospel of Luke, Jesus&rsquo; last recorded words were &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.&rdquo; Satoshi, on the other hand, checked out of this world in the belief that those around him knew exactly what they were doing. As he was to <a href="https://pastebin.com/syrmi3ET">remark</a> in one of his final emails, sent to Mike Hearn on April 23, 2011, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve moved on to other things. It&rsquo;s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satoshi had nursed Bitcoin through its formative years, and now it was capable of surviving without him solo mining, solo-fixing critical bugs and pushing out new Core releases. Perhaps Satoshi left because he had done all he had to do. Staying around would only tarnish his legacy and heighten the risk of him being doxxed as the world began to take a keen interest in his creation.</p>
<p>If so, the timing of Satoshi&rsquo;s exit was to prove as impeccable as his arrival in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite internecine conflict, chain splits, and factions, Bitcoin hasn&rsquo;t just survived &ndash; it&rsquo;s thrived, morphing into an unstoppable organism that cannot be controlled by any one man.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">In the Name of Saving Central Banks</h2>
<p>Unlike a normal business in the private sector, government organizations and the institutions embedded therein are often immune from market consequence. This fact was possibly hinted at by the creator of Bitcoin himself when he included the text &ldquo;The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&rdquo; in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-years-ago-bitcoins-genesis-block-changed-the-course-of-history/">genesis block</a>. The Argentinian central bank crackdown on USD purchases is further proof of this notable lack of consequence for policy makers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/amp/economy/us200-limit-central-bank-tightens-currency-controls-in-wake-of-election.phtml">reports</a>, the new limit on USD purchases in Argentina is designed to &ldquo;preserve the reserves of the Central Bank.&rdquo; The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) said in a statement that &ldquo;Given the current degree of uncertainty, the Board of Directors of BCRA decided to take a series of measures this Sunday that seek to preserve the reserves of the Central Bank. The measures announced are temporary, until December 2019.&rdquo; The bank is worried about the potential collapse of the Argentine peso (ARS), which has <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/10/28/argentine-president-elect-faces-full-in-tray-of-economic-woes">devalued</a> by almost 85% in just under four years.</p>
<p>Fern&aacute;ndez is set to fully assume the role of president on December 10, and Argentines were already preparing for possible increased controls in the wake of his election. As the Buenos Aires Times relays:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week Argentines rushed to buy dollars and withdraw deposits ahead of the vote on concern that more controls were coming amid an economic crisis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though news.Bitcoin.com had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/capital-controls-in-argentina-demonstrate-dangers-of-government-controlled-money/">reported</a> in early September that the lesser capital controls of that time (a purchase limit of $10,000 USD per month) mostly affected businesses, the new, stricter regime of $200 per month affects potentially everyone. Though the measures are said to be temporary, uncertainty remains and understandably so. Governments have never been dependable when it comes to money management. Indeed, as Ana Eiras and Brett Schaefer of the Heritage Foundation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119174030/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2001/04/argentinas-economic-crisis-an-absence-of-capitalism">noted</a> back in 2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poor economic policies and political instability contributed to Argentina&rsquo;s decline from its noteworthy position as the world&rsquo;s 10th wealthiest nation in 1913 to the world&rsquo;s 36th wealthiest in 1998.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to note that centralized policy guidance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) only made things worse, claiming &ldquo;Argentina is the only wealthy country to experience so great a reversal in recent history, despite the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Indeed, the IMF&rsquo;s loans and guidance have aggravated, not alleviated, Argentina&rsquo;s problems.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Your Money Is Not Yours</h2>
<p>Protests against unfair and reckless economic policy are currently happening worldwide. Along with Argentina, Chile, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Egypt and Lebanon are some of the current hotbeds of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-demand-for-permissionless-freedom-is-just-getting-started/">economic unrest</a>. India&rsquo;s case is particularly noteworthy as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-crisis-spreads-in-india-deaths-strike-supreme-court-denial/">reports</a> have emerged of people dying as a result of lack of access to the money in their bank accounts. As for Lebanon, banks have now been closed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lebanese-protestors-gather-at-central-bank-as-financial-lockout-continues/">over a week</a>, with news outlet Aljazeera reporting on October 29:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lebanon&rsquo;s banking association said banks would remain shut on Tuesday for a tenth straight working day, but said the central bank had provided the liquidity necessary to pay out salaries for public sector workers, including members of security forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Chile ATMs are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cash-runs-dry-at-atms-as-protests-escalate-in-chile/">reportedly</a> running out of cash and becoming non-functional amidst the turmoil of current protests, seeing grocery stores begin to run out of food and infrastructure being burned and destroyed by frustrated demonstrators. Meanwhile, central banks and financial planners continue to drive the world economy further into debt-based dysfunction via negative rate policies, quantitative easing, and a fiat printing press.</p>
<p>When the rubber meets the road, it is always the individuals in these countries who must pay, as recent events are showing. When a restaurant serves awful food with poor service in the private sector, it goes out of business. When the state destroys an economy, they simply raise taxes, lock up the money, devalue it and make you pay for their mistakes. In light of this knowledge, the demand for economically sound, permissionless alternatives like <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/">bitcoin</a> grows more and more pronounced, as individuals worldwide realize full ownership of their hard-earned assets is a basic human right.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Purchasing SLP Tokens With Fiat</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptophyl.com/">Cryptophyl.com</a> has revealed the public can now purchase SLP tokens using fiat via credit cards, debit cards, and Apple Pay. The Cryptophyl team is collaborating with the payment processor <a href="https://www.moonpay.io">Moonpay</a> in order to facilitate the fiat on-ramp. The SLP token ecosystem has grown quite mature this year and thousands of tokens have been created using the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> network. <a href="https://simpleledger.info">Data reveals</a> there&rsquo;s been 5,400 SLP tokens minted since the inception of the protocol and a slew of tokens have been listed on exchanges. Cryptophyl launched in August and initially offered <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/tokens/SPICE">spice (SPICE)</a> trading with bitcoin cash but the trading platform now has <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/tokens/USDH">honestcoin (USDH)</a> and the Cryptophyl developed drop (DROP) token. Cryptophyl&rsquo;s native exchange token drop leverages the ability to utilize onchain dividends by paying holders airdropped tokens directly to their wallets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-343368 size-full" title="Cryptophyl Exchange Reveals Fiat On-Ramp to SLP Token Ecosystem" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd.jpg" alt="Cryptophyl Exchange Reveals Fiat On-Ramp to SLP Token Ecosystem" width="1300" height="600" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd.jpg 1300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd-300x138.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd-768x354.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd-1024x473.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd-696x321.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd-1068x493.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hhshshhdhgdggdggdgdd-910x420.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px"></p>
<p>Now the Cryptophyl team has partnered with Moonpay to provide credit and debit card support to Cryptophyl&rsquo;s exchange platform. Cryptophyl&rsquo;s initial fiat payments launch will provide users access to spice and the stablecoin USDH. In the near future, credit and debit card payments can be used to obtain bitcoin cash and drop as well. &ldquo;We are proud to partner with Cryptophyl to support instant purchases of SLP tokens,&rdquo; said Ivan Soto-Wright, cofounder and CEO at Moonpay. &ldquo;Reducing the barriers to entry is critical for mainstream adoption.&rdquo; Moonpay users will have a connection to the SLP universe as well &ldquo;expanding the reach of SLP to all users of Moonpay integrated products,&rdquo; Cryptophyl&rsquo;s announcement highlighted.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Making Bitcoin Cash Token Trading More Accessible</h2>
<p>According to the Cryptophyl team, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/honestnode-founder-discusses-the-first-stablecoin-built-on-bitcoin-cash/">honestcoin</a> (USDH) and spice (SPICE) are the most popular tokens on the trading platform. Moonpay and Cryptophyl&rsquo;s fiat on-ramp will charge a fee of 3.99% per transaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see the addition of credit card support to Cryptophyl,&rdquo; Semyon Germanovich, Cryptophyl&rsquo;s founder, detailed during the announcement. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re constantly working hard to make token trading more accessible. We&rsquo;re excited to connect Moonpay&rsquo;s existing userbase with some of the most popular SLP tokens out there.&rdquo; Germanovich added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>This is a big moment for SLP tokens, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to see SLP mature over time, and be a part of this journey. This is the beginning of many great things to come for Bitcoin Cash and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Since Cryptophyl&rsquo;s inception, the trading platform has been focused on the token technology tethered to the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> network. The exchange aims to continue expanding the list of SLP pairs on the trading engine. &ldquo;This mission is achieved through the discovery, due diligence and subsequent listing of quality tokens that demonstrate real-world utility,&rdquo; Cryptophyl&rsquo;s announcement notes. &ldquo;Moving forward, both companies have committed to work together to add all new Cryptophyl listed tokens to Moonpay.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Canaan Files for US IPO</h2>
<p>Canaan Inc., a holding company that owns China-based Canaan Creative, filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Oct. 28 for an initial public offering (IPO). &ldquo;We are offering American depositary shares, or ADSs. Each ADS represents Class A ordinary shares, par value US$0.00000005 per share,&rdquo; the filing details. The company hopes to raise $400 million.</p>
<p>The underwriters named in the filing for the IPO are Credit Suisse, Citigroup, China Renaissance, CMBI, Galaxy Digital Advisors, Huatai Securities, and Tiger Brokers. The company plans to apply to list its ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CAN. Canaan also told the SEC that, based on a report by independent research firm Frost & Sullivan which it paid for:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were the second largest designer and manufacturer of bitcoin mining machines globally in terms of computing power sold in the six months ended June 30, 2019.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds to research and develop ASICs related to AI and blockchain algorithms and applications, expand its AI and blockchain business globally, optimize supply chains, and repay debts.</p>

<p>Canaan attempted an IPO in Hong Kong last year but let the application lapse in November. The South China Morning Post reported that Hong Kong regulators said IPOs by cryptocurrency businesses are &ldquo;premature.&rdquo; The company also attempted to go public in China three years ago through a reverse merger by buying a Shandong-based electric equipment maker, but that plan also fell through.</p>
<p>Canaan&rsquo;s Nasdaq IPO filing comes only days after Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-ranks-35-crypto-projects-as-president-xi-pushes-blockchain/">commented</a> on the development of blockchain technology in China which sent shares of blockchain and digital currency-related firms soaring. Some even speculated that Xi&rsquo;s speech <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-crypto-prices-hold-steady-after-massive-bullish-spike/">caused</a> the recent hike in prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Canaan and Avalonminers</h2>
<p>Founded in 2013, Canaan provides &ldquo;supercomputing solutions through our proprietary high-performance computing ASICs,&rdquo; its registration statement reads. The company currently sells bitcoin mining machines under the Avalonminer brand and mining machine parts. In July, the company started leasing its mining machines.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s total revenue was $394.1 million in 2018, a 106.8% increase year-on-year, but its net income fell 67.4% last year to $17.8 million. For the six months period ending June 30, the total revenue fell 85.2% compared to the same period last year to $42.1 million. The company also recorded a net loss of $48.2 million during that time period.</p>

<p>According to the filing, since the company has less than $1.07 million in revenue for the last fiscal year, it qualifies as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). &ldquo;An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise not applicable generally to public companies,&rdquo; the filing details.</p>
<p>The company recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/4-new-high-powered-bitcoin-miners-revealed/">introduced</a> two new lines of Avalonminers: the A1146 and the A1166. The former rig processes bitcoins&rsquo; hashes at speeds of 46-56TH/s, with a power efficiency rated at around 57J/T, and a price tag of $1,204. The latter costs $1,978 and performs at 66-68TH/s with a power efficiency of around 47J/T. Both are expected to ship in February, according to the company&rsquo;s website.</p>
