<h2 style="text-align: center;">New Silk Road Documentary Discusses How Ross Ulbricht Handed the Reins Over to Another Individual</h2>
<p>Since the Silk Road marketplace was seized and Ross Ulbricht incarcerated, many facets of the case have remained a mystery to this day. The video published on Youtube on November 26 by the nonprofit organization Freeross.org tries to unravel some of the riddles behind the Silk Road investigation. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NZxivue5Ng&feature=youtu.be">Silk Road Case: The Real, Untold Story</a>&rdquo; contains information that has never been publicly released before as well as underreported information from sources derived from various subjects, court filings, transcripts, trial exhibits, and affidavits.</p>

<p>When Ross started the Silk Road, he called it a &ldquo;free-market economic experiment&rdquo; and he wholeheartedly believed &ldquo;people should have the right to buy and sell whatever they wanted, so long as they weren&rsquo;t hurting anyone else.&rdquo; Just a few months after the market launch, the news outlet gawker.com published an article about the Silk Road, which went viral and eventually reached the ears of politicians and law enforcement. New York Senator Chuck Schumer called for immediate action against the Silk Road marketplace and at the time, it was called the &lsquo;Schumer&rsquo;s case.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Because Ross lacked the technical knowledge and programming abilities to run a marketplace as large as the Silk Road, he started asking friends for help. A close friend didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with the market, so Ross turned to an anonymous individual. &ldquo;A stranger provided the needed help and eventually took control of the site entirely,&rdquo; the video&rsquo;s narrator highlights. Moreover, the unknown Silk Road leader did an interview with the press shortly after Ross handed the market over. &ldquo;I was in his corner from early on and eventually it made sense for me to take the reins,&rdquo; the new DPR explained during his interview. In November 2011 following the transition, Ross told his close friend in an online chat room:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Glad that&rsquo;s not my problem anymore.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most people are unaware that after Ross gave up the reins, the new unknown leader of the Silk Road announced his infamous screen name on February 6, 2012. The newly appointed administrator told the public his name was the &ldquo;Dread Pirate Roberts&rdquo; (DPR) from the film &ldquo;The Princess Bride.&rdquo; Similarly to the movie script, DPR passed his name down to each successor and with the Silk Road, it&rsquo;s still unknown how many DPRs existed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Magical Tux, Rogue Agents, and How the Justice System Failed Miserably</h2>
<p>After detailing that there were other players who filled the DPR role, the recently published video also discussed how the former Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was a top suspect in the Silk Road case. Lots of the film&rsquo;s narration stems from public information sources and explains how Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan thought that Mark Karpeles was involved with the market operations.</p>
<figure id="attachment_350012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350012" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350012 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-300x100.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-768x256.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-696x232.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1392x464.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1068x356.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1260x420.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350012" class="wp-caption-text">From left to right: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and his assistant Ashley Barr.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Der-Yeghiayan discovered a website on the clearnet called silkroadmarket.org that taught people how to use the market. According to Der-Yeghiayan&rsquo;s investigation, its URL was registered with XTA.net. Then subpoenas revealed that XTA.net was owned by Mark Karpeles&rsquo; firm Mutum Sigillum. Der-Yeghiayan stated that Karpeles operated &ldquo;hundreds of websites,&rdquo; which &ldquo;[made him] well-suited to operating a site such as the Silk Road.&rdquo; The HSI agent&rsquo;s reports also found that Karpeles used similar software to program his websites. In April 2012, Der-Yeghiayan believed that Karpeles and one of his associates, Ashley Barr, operated the Silk Road and controlled the DPR handle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_350014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350014" style="width: 546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350014" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues.jpg" alt="" width="546" height="273" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350014" class="wp-caption-text">The two rogue agents: DEA agent Carl Mark Force (left) and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges (right).</figcaption></figure>
<p>The comprehensive film also explains how another federal agent took control of the Silk Road case and took all of Der-Yeghiayan&rsquo;s evidence. The video details how the same federal agent &ldquo;leaked investigation details to two Baltimore agents&rdquo; who eventually went rogue. DEA agent Carl Mark Force and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges were later found guilty for manipulating the case and stealing millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. The two-hour film contains a lot of information from the server takedown, the setup and arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the deletion of evidence during the investigation and how the entire case was an abomination of justice.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Bitcoin Fund IPO</h2>
<p>Crypto-focused Canadian investment fund manager 3IQ Corp. announced on Thursday that it has filed a preliminary prospectus for the IPO of The Bitcoin Fund. More importantly, the prospectus dated Nov. 27 has been receipted by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) after previously rejecting it. The IPO will offer two classes of units at $10 each.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Fund is a closed-end investment fund established as a trust under Ontario&rsquo;s laws, the company explained, adding that &ldquo;the units will be an eligible qualified investment for registered investment accounts.&rdquo; The fund&rsquo;s investment objectives are to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation and exposure to bitcoin and its daily price movement in USD, the announcement details.</p>

<p>Founded in 2012, 3IQ already manages two other private digital asset funds for accredited investors in Canada. It will act as The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s investment and portfolio manager. The crypto-focused company has been working to bring a public bitcoin fund to market for Canadian retail investors since 2016.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Success After a Long Battle</h2>
<p>3IQ Corp. originally filed a preliminary prospectus for the IPO of The Bitcoin Fund with the OSC&rsquo;s Investment Funds & Structures Projects branch (IFSP) in October last year. However, the staff raised a number of concerns after reviewing it, arguing that the fund was not in the public interest of Canadians. This resulted in the IFSP director rejecting the fund&rsquo;s prospectus in February. The company then requested a hearing and a review of this decision. After a public hearing and several meetings, OSC Commissioner Lawrence P. Haber <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/osc-commissioner-debunks-arguments-against-bitcoin-green-lights-bitcoin-fund/">ruled</a> that the staff&rsquo;s concerns &ldquo;do not warrant denying a receipt for The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s prospectus.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-349860 aligncenter" title="Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada.jpg" alt="Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The commissioner believes that it is not the role of securities regulators to approve or disapprove of the merits of the underlying investment being offered to the public &mdash; bitcoin in this case. Among other bullish statements, he said, &ldquo;there is sufficient evidence of real volume and real trading in bitcoin on registered exchanges in large dollar size.&rdquo; After addressing each point of concern raised by the staff, the commissioner ordered the IFSP director to issue a receipt for the fund&rsquo;s prospectus unless new evidence was found to warrant a rejection. Several weeks later, the company announced that the regulator has finally issued a receipt for the fund&rsquo;s prospectus.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the staff noted that &ldquo;there are remaining steps for completion before a final offering prospectus can be receipted.&rdquo; Particularly, Commissioner Haber&rsquo;s order reveals that the final prospectus would include additional information regarding the offering such as pricing information and details regarding underwriters. The order further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>3IQ also confirmed that it does intend to offer units of the fund to Canadian retail investors in all provinces and territories of Canada.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company has clarified that the preliminary prospectus is subject to completion or amendment, and the sale will commence after the regulator has issued a receipt for the final prospectus.</p>

To many observers, the downtime has been very long after the rough crypto winter of 2018, but so far it&rsquo;s only been 711 days since the last price high.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Traders Patiently Wait for the Next Bull Run</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">Digital currency and BTC prices</a> rebounded after the fall in 2018 but not everyone is convinced the bearish sentiment is over. Optimism exists because on December 7 at approximately 8:05 EST, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices dropped to a low of $3,306 per coin but since then <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has regained at least half of the percentage losses. Positivity jumped back in the summer when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> rose 320% from the December 2018 low to a high of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20130428&end=20191130">$13,311</a> on June 27. But after that, expectations dropped when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices slid to the $7K region during the last week of October. The dip made people wonder if the crypto winter was still alive and well. However, on October 24 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices popped again from a low of $7,446 to a high of $10,021 on October 26. Since then <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices have been dragging low again and 27 days later the value dropped under $7K to a low of $6,400.</p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">gained 5-7%</a> in the last seven days and most digital asset markets seem to be in a recovery phase after the drops in value. One way to figure out how much longer it will be until the next ATH is by measuring how long it&rsquo;s been since the last <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price high. Historical data shows that between November 30, 2013 when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> surpassed $1,100 per coin it took <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-days-since-high/">1,170 days</a> to surpass the 2013 ATH on February 13, 2017. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kitconews/2013/12/10/2013-year-of-the-bitcoin/#6e9b9a94303c">Various factors</a> drove the price up in 2013 like Mt Gox bots, the Cyprus banking crisis, and Chinese demand. Similarly, feverish retail demand, excitement for regulated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> futures, economic hardships in Greece and Venezuela, South Korean demand, and the initial coin offering (ICO) boom helped fortify the 2017 ATH. When the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) initiated its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> futures markets and CME Group (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) followed with its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> derivatives products, spot markets were on fire. From February 13 to December 17, 2017, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> jumped 1,629% to its current ATH of $19,891 per coin.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">711 Days Since the December 17 All-Time High</h2>
<p>Another set of factors helped the price slide after touching near $20K per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Crypto enthusiasts witnessed the regulatory crackdown in South Korea, heightened regulatory guidelines in the U.S., EU and other regions worldwide, and the ICO market got slammed with regulations and criminal enforcement. Still, there are 459 days left if we look at the days between the 2013 ATH to when it touched again in 2017. So far there&rsquo;s only been <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-days-since-high/">711 days</a> between the ATH of $19,891 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Since the network launch on January 3, 2009 up until November 30, there&rsquo;s been approximately 3,983 days between.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-days-since-high/">Data also shows</a> that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has been on the up roughly 3,573 days of its existence which turns out to be 89% of its life cycle. During the downtimes, however, crypto enthusiasts grow very impatient and this is quite prevalent on social media and forums at the end of 2019. Investing in cryptos is really not good for health, years of bear markets followed by a few days of bull run hysteria &mdash; And FUD all along,&rdquo; one person <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPprophet/status/1197839221735731201">remarked</a> on Twitter this week. &ldquo;707 days of bear market &mdash; I think we need a break please,&rdquo; another crypto proponent <a href="https://twitter.com/akhillesart/status/1198487204290605056">said</a> on Sunday. On November 25 after <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices were drifting downward another trader on Twitter stated:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>In terms of [percentages], we&rsquo;re almost exactly where we were this many days after the bottom in 2014. The explosion out of the bear market was too quick and too irrational. This prolonged correction is normal. Markets never repeat, but they rhyme. This is just the 3rd verse.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The wait has been long and many people believe that being patient will reap the most rewards as the overall value of cryptocurrencies, in general, is headed northbound. As news.Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/author/grahamsmith/">Graham Smith</a> reported on November 24, data shows that despite the market turbulence, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-market-turbulence-bitcoins-support-lines-remain-intact/">BTC&rsquo;s support lines remain intact</a>. Just as no one was certain when the bear market would end after the 2013 ATH, this time around enthusiasts and traders are still guessing wildly. Analysts can log trendlines and trace historical patterns and we can measure days between ATHs as well, but we are mostly dependent on guesstimates and faith.</p>

Its price jumped well over 30% on Thursday, from $0.0310 per coin early on Nov. 28 to over $0.0450 a few hours later, and to a record high of 0.0473 on Friday, Nov. 29. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">SAI Maintains New Higher Price Range</h2>
<p>SAI is the native token of <a href="https://sideshift.ai/btc/bch">Sideshift AI</a>, an automated coin swapping platform that allows users to quickly exchange around two dozen cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), bitcoin core (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and several stablecoins. Of course, it supports SAI as well, which exists as a Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) token, an ERC-20 token and on the Liquid inter-exchange settlement network. It has a limited supply and only 210 million SAI will ever be minted.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-349872 size-full" title="Sideshift SLP Token SAI Gains Over 30% in Less Than 24 Hours" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sai-logo.jpg" alt="Sideshift SLP Token SAI Gains Over 30% in Less Than 24 Hours" width="533" height="277" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sai-logo.jpg 533w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sai-logo-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></p>
<p>The token is currently used to pay out rewards that can be earned by becoming a Sideshift <a href="https://sideshift.ai/affiliate">affiliate</a>. The exchange plans to increase its implementation in interactions with its services and other vendors. That includes rewards for takers of exchange orders, rebates when using SAI to pay fees, discounts for SAI merchant payments, paying employees, contractors, service providers, and partners in SAI. In the future, the crypto may be used to &ldquo;buy-and-burn&rdquo; Sideshift AI profits, offer trade incentives, and create merchant discounts, the platform&rsquo;s website details.</p>
<p>For the better part of the past 10 days, SAI&rsquo;s price stayed in the range between a low of $0.0272 and a high of $0.0346, data provided by markets.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/tokens/SAI">shows</a>. A significant upward movement began on Thursday, Nov. 28, when the price jumped from around $0.0308 to a record high of 0.0473 the following day, an increase of close to 35% for a little over 24 hours. Following a modest correction, the token is trading at around $0.0464 at the time of writing, preserving most of its price gains. Currently SAI has a market cap of over $568,000 and a 24-hour volume of $4.45 million.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Exchange Listings and SAI&rsquo;s Utility Increase Its Value</h2>
<p>SAI is currently trading at three cryptocurrency exchanges &ndash; <a href="https://sideshift.ai/btc/bch">Sideshift AI</a>, <a href="https://www.coinex.com/?refer_code=2a59x">Coinex</a>, and the <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com Exchange</a>. A major factor for the token&rsquo;s price increase may have been the recent announcement of its upcoming listing on a fourth platform. Last Sunday, Nov. 24, <a href="https://blog.cryptophyl.com">Cryptophyl</a> revealed it will be listing SAI in the first days of next month. The exchange also plans to airdrop 50,000 SAI tokens to holders of its own token, DROP. Users who have the coin in their wallets are eligible to receive token airdrops. The SAI-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> market will go live at 09:00 UTC, Dec. 3, the <a href="https://blog.cryptophyl.com/blog/announcing-sai-listing-and-airdrop/">announcement</a> detailed.</p>
<p>Andreas Brekken, the developer who launched Sideshift, told news.Bitcoin.com that the platform is excited to have its SAI token as one of the first SLP tokens listed on the Bitcoin.com Exchange. While price discovery is an efficient process, he noted, it can take time for market participants to research tokens and to have that reflected in the market. Commenting on SAI&rsquo;s recent price spike, he further elaborated:</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center">
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>The price increase of SAI is a result of buying pressure, likely from buyers having had time to research the utility of SAI and the promises of an automated coin swap service that doesn&rsquo;t require users to register an account to perform trades.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SLP tokens based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have been growing in number and approximately 5,000 have been created so far. They are issued by various projects and designed with a myriad of uses in mind. As news.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/slp-token-ecosystem-built-on-bitcoin-cash-continues-to-blossom/">reported</a> in October, transactions using the SLP framework have increased significantly during the course of this year as well. The whole ecosystem has been expanding and besides many options to buy SLP tokens, you can also freely <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">trade</a> and safely <a href="https://badger.bitcoin.com">store</a> them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitcoin.com">Bitcoin.com</a> has been an active supporter of the adoption of the Simple Ledger Protocol, a system allowing anyone to create tokens based on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> network in a permissionless manner. One of the main reasons for the launch of Exchange.Bitcoin.com was to provide SLP projects with a platform to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/universal-protocol-alliance-to-list-mega-utility-token-on-bitcoin-com-exchange/">list</a> their various SLP tokens. An example of joint efforts in that direction is the integration of Sideshift, the issuer of the SAI token, with the <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com wallet</a>, which allows you to swap <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> within your mobile wallet app.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">US Attorney&rsquo;s Office Arrests Virgil Griffith for Teaching Blockchain Technology to North Koreans</h2>
<p>The U.S. Attorney SDNY and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-arrest-united-states-citizen-assisting-north-korea">announced</a> charges against <a href="https://twitter.com/virgilgr">Virgil Griffith</a> on November 29 detailing that the American citizen violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

<p>U.S. law enforcement agencies allege that Griffith traveled to North Korea (DPRK) and gave &ldquo;a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.&rdquo; &ldquo;Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States&rsquo; foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,&rdquo; Assistant Attorney General John Demers said. &ldquo;By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ostensibly Griffith also traveled to the DPRK to present at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference despite the Department of State denying him permission to travel to DPRK. &ldquo;At no time did Griffith obtain permission from OFAC,&rdquo; the SDNY press release stressed. U.S. citizens and businesses are not permitted to transact with persons and companies on the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/default.aspx">OFAC list</a>. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list is a record of individuals and companies that are tied to targeted or sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, Griffith and other attendees discussed how the DPRK could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions,&rdquo; the SDNY statement stressed. Griffith was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on November 28 and reportedly attended court the next day.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;A Government Corrupt at the Core&rsquo;</h2>
<p>After the cryptocurrency community caught wind of the news about Griffith&rsquo;s arrest many people were <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Virgil%20Griffith&src=typed_query">angered</a> at the U.S. government&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;Teaching about blockchain technology is illegal now in the Land of the Free,&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1200509621590315008">remarked</a> Shapeshift&rsquo;s CEO Erik Voorhees on Twitter. Some people mentioned how Griffith openly <a href="https://twitter.com/virgilgr/status/1161217917427470337">tweeted</a> about getting a Visa to DPRK and that the U.S. government took notice. &ldquo;Virgil&rsquo;s situation was avoidable to be sure &mdash; But this may be a sign of things to come,&rdquo; Coin Metric&rsquo;s founder Nic Carter <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1200542134232850465">opined</a>. &ldquo;Ultimately anyone writing code or creating resources for crypto can be alleged to be helping hostile jurisdictions avoid sanctions under this loose standard, whether or not they intend to,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>The notorious U.S. presidential candidate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-history-of-violent-intervention-john-mcafee-to-help-cuba-resist-us-sanctions-with-crypto/">John McAfee</a> said that the American government was dishonest. &ldquo;Virgil Griffith arrested for teaching North Korea how to avoid U.S. sanctions by using cryptocurrency and the Blockchain. See what our Government has become &mdash; A government corrupt at the core, declaring publicly available information a national secret,&rdquo; McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1200540436391251968">exclaimed</a>. Another person responded to McAfee&rsquo;s statement and <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielHarshman8/status/1200541272047374337">said</a>: &ldquo;Arrested for opposing the Wall Street/London Cartel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 36-year old Griffith is a resident of Singapore and citizen of the United States and his charges carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison if convicted. &ldquo;The charge in the Complaint is merely an accusation,&rdquo; explain the law enforcement agencies handling the case which include Counterintelligence, Export Control Section, and the Southern District&rsquo;s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Proponents Discuss Double Spends, Honoring the &lsquo;First Seen,&rsquo; and Current Zero-Confirmation Security</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) participants have always been intrigued by zero-confirmation transactions and concepts like double spend proofs that could strengthen instant transactions. Essentially a double spend is when someone tries to spend the same <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> to two different addresses. Even though it&rsquo;s not common, double spends on digital currencies like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a> can occur. The website <a href="https://doublespend.cash">doublespend.cash</a> tracks attempts and successful double spends on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. A Reddit user called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dagurval/">Dagurval</a>, a Bitcoin XT software developer and the creator of the data site, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/">explained</a> on Thursday that in order for double spends to succeed, they have to be sent simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only 1 out of 1,104 double spend attempts succeeded when broadcast more than 1 second later,&rdquo; the developer announced on Reddit. &ldquo;The chart &lsquo;Time between first seen and second seen&rsquo; shows the time difference between seeing the first transaction and the double spend,&rdquo; Dagurval told <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> supporters. The developer <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8yug52/">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>It demonstrates that in most cases, only when submitted simultaneously can a double spend succeed. It also shows that miners honor the &lsquo;first seen&rsquo; policy.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>After Dagurval posted the data, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> community discussed the risks of double spends and debated certain scenarios between a double spender and a merchant. &ldquo;Good to know, so it means 0-conf is quite safe and [double spend] proofs will make it safer,&rdquo; one user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8z0deg/">remarked</a>. Others were not so convinced and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8zu0so/">said</a> that &ldquo;unless you can measure how many of these are deliberate attempts of fraud, you can&rsquo;t somehow imply security from this figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-349773" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-768x432.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-696x392.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-1392x783.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-747x420.jpg 747w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daily-1920x1080.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;What [the data] means is that a merchant willing to wait three seconds to see if a duplicate transaction appears is roughly 99.9% safe in accepting an unconfirmed low-value transaction,&rdquo; Reddit user Jessquit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8zwoyl/">wrote</a> in response to the implication of security. The discussion was a popular debate on the subreddit r/btc, as the conversation would have likely been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brief-history-censorship-bitcoin/">censored</a> on the subreddit forum <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-mod-explains-r-bitcoin-censorship-and-why-he-was-removed/">r/bitcoin</a>. Dagurval&rsquo;s doublespend.cash statistics also had people discussing the idea of double spend proofs, a concept a few <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> developers have been experimenting with over the last few years.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Bitcoin Snack Machine and the Quest for Double Spend Proofs</h2>
<p>In July, news.Bitcoin.com reported on <a href="https://flowee.org/">Flowee the Hub</a> lead developer Tom Zander&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-bitcoin-cash-specs-propose-heightened-privacy-and-double-spend-proofs/">implementation</a> of a double spend proof-of-concept. The protocol documentation was also authored by the software developer <a href="https://twitter.com/im_uname">Imaginary Username</a> and programmer <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLundeberg">Mark Lundeberg </a>also contributed. BCHD and Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia wrote documentation for a system called the <a href="https://github.com/cpacia/spec/blob/master/double-spend-alerts.md">Double Spend Alert</a>. In 2015, former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn wrote about the subject in a <a href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/double-spending-in-bitcoin-be0f1d1e8008">paper</a> called &ldquo;Double spending in Bitcoin and how to make it harder.&rdquo; Hearn&rsquo;s research noted Gavin Andresen and Bitcoin XT developer Tom Harding&rsquo;s work on double spend relaying. Harding has researched the subject a great deal and he discussed a double spend relay detection system in his presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=OAt6B7b4GeM">Native Respend Resistance</a> at the 2018 Satoshi Vision Conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The quest for stopping even the 1 out of 1,105 successful double spends that are spent simultaneously has been something developers have strived for since Bitcoin was first created. Even Satoshi Nakamoto discussed the topic of zero-confirmation acceptance back in July 2010. In a well known bitcointalk.org thread called the &ldquo;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819">Bitcoin Snack Machine</a>,&rdquo; Satoshi said: &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;ll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.&rdquo; During the vending machine conversation, Satoshi also talked about honoring the &lsquo;first seen&rsquo; policy and a race between transactions sent fractions of a second ahead of each other.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-349777" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="600" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-300x120.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-768x307.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-696x278.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1392x557.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1068x427.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1050x420.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they&rsquo;re trying to generate,&rdquo; Satoshi said at the time. &ldquo;When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it&rsquo;s a race to propagate to the most nodes first. If one has a slight head start, it&rsquo;ll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">German Banks Will Soon Be Able to Manage Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>According to the regional financial news publication Handelsblatt, in 2020 banking institutions from Germany will be able to manage <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">cryptocurrencies</a> for customers. Under newly enacted legislation, banks in Germany will be able to receive, store, and sell digital assets like bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>). Directive 2015/849 is an amended regulatory approach that was issued by the European Parliament and German politicians. The fourth EU money laundering directive highlights the fact that &ldquo;electronic money products is increasingly considered to be a substitute for bank accounts.&rdquo; Handelsblatt reporter Felix Holtermann reveals that the new directive&rsquo;s &ldquo;deletion of the so-called separation bid&rdquo; makes it so German banks can handle cryptocurrencies without needing to use a third-party custodian. Prior to erasing this part of the guidelines, the directive would have required banks to use &ldquo;external custodians or special subsidiaries&rdquo; to store the cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>In 2020, German banks will be able to offer cryptocurrency solutions alongside bonds, equities, and traditional stocks. The banks will need to procure a license to offer digital asset custodial services, but the directive extends application deadlines. The consulting firm <a href="https://distributed-ledger-consulting.de">DLC&rsquo;s</a> executive Sven Hildebrandt believes the initiative puts Germany ahead of the game. &ldquo;Germany is well on its way to becoming a crypto-heaven,&rdquo; Hildebrandt remarked. &ldquo;The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of cryptocurrencies.&rdquo; The cofounder of the crypto data aggregator website Coingecko, <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyong">Bobby Ong</a>, says that banks offering these types of services open financial institutions to a lot of opportunities. Ong <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyong/status/1200413251504205824">explained</a> on Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Just like how banks sell gold, stocks, unit trusts, and insurance directly to retail consumers now, I see no reason why banks will not offer cryptocurrencies for sale now. What&rsquo;s taking these bankers so long? It&rsquo;s a big gold mine waiting to be tapped.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">While Some Welcome the New Guidelines, Other Are More Critical of the Fourth EU Directive</h2>
<p>Local reports underline that the German banking association <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.bankenverband.de">Bundesverband deutscher Banken</a> </span>(BdB) &ldquo;welcomed the new regulation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Credit institutions are experienced in the safekeeping of client assets and in risk management, are committed to investor protection and have always been controlled by the financial supervision,&rdquo; the banking association said. BdB added that the new directive makes it possible for investors to invest in digital assets domestically rather than searching elsewhere for foreign funds. The CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1200375449622208514">emphasized</a> after the German bank crypto announcement that &ldquo;smart banks do this&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bitcoin [is] still not dead.&rdquo; Other critics don&rsquo;t find the fourth EU money laundering directive so inviting and friendly. &ldquo;With the new AML law, it affects the whole EU &mdash; combine this with negative interest rates for billions of euros which are sitting in their bank accounts &mdash; Next year everyone in the EU will get a bill for holding fiat in their bank accounts,&rdquo; a skeptic <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPrinter/status/1200378072954023938">wrote</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_349713" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-349713" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-349713 size-full" title="German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive.jpg" alt="German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020" width="1500" height="600" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-300x120.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-768x307.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-696x278.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1392x557.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1068x427.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1050x420.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-349713" class="wp-caption-text">The fourth EU money laundering directive.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another detractor against German banks holding <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">cryptocurrencies</a> is Baden-Wuerttemberg executive Niels Nauhauser. The financial analyst told the Handelsblatt that the new directives will add more strain to consumer protection advocates. &ldquo;If [German banks] are allowed to sell cryptocurrencies and keep them for a fee, they run the risk of turning their assets at risk of a total loss to their clients, without them knowing what they are getting into.&rdquo; Nauhauser also stressed that banks already have to inform customers about the costs and risks associated with investment vehicles like bonds and equities. The Baden-Wuerttemberg analyst underlined that direct sales of digital assets will need the same attention.</p>

According to the paper, &#8220;heavy reliance on electricity has created scalability issues, environmental concerns, and systemic risks.&#8221; The authors state that silicon photonics could be used to shift mining [&#8230;]</p>

According to the paper, &ldquo;heavy reliance on electricity has created scalability issues, environmental concerns, and systemic risks.&rdquo; The authors state that silicon photonics could be used to shift mining costs away from energy-intensive to hardware-based costs, lowering the economic and environmental impact, adding greater security, and &ldquo;democratizing&rdquo; mining. </strong></p>

<h2 class="title mathjax" style="text-align: center;">Optical Proof of Work</h2>
<p>The system proposed by authors Michael Dubrovsky, Marshall Ball, and Bogdan Penkovsky is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05193">described</a> as &ldquo;a novel POW algorithm, Optical Proof of Work (OPOW), to eliminate energy as the primary cost of mining. Proposed algorithm imposes economic difficulty on the miners, however, the cost is concentrated in hardware (capital expense-CAPEX) rather than electricity (operating expenses-OPEX).&rdquo; In other words, the paper&rsquo;s proposal is that photonics could potentially enable much more energy efficient <a href="https://mining.bitcoin.com">mining</a>, which might have a number of effects on the industry.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Optical Proof of Work&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05193.pdf">paper</a> states that &ldquo;Rapid growth and improvement in silicon photonics over the last two decades has led to the commercialization of silicon photonic co-processors (integrated circuits that use photons instead of electrons to perform specialized computing tasks) for low-energy deep learning. OPOW is optimized for this technology such that miners are incentivized to use specialized, energy-efficient photonics for computation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many questions remain as to the proposed implementation, however, centering on the economic realities of market competition and economies of scale, as well as changes at the algorithm level which would need to take place. Also, although the proposal is to make mining hardware much more specialized and difficult to acquire, unique from system to system (to disincentivize risks like 51% attacks), footnotes in the paper admit there could be exceptions. &ldquo;Although not impossible, a coordinated effort to rent on the order of half of the hardware on a network would be difficult to hide and owners of hardware have an incentive not to rent to attackers, as the hardware is likely to lose value if the network is attacked.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dubrovsky&rsquo;s Thoughts on the Proposal</h2>
<p>Michael Dubrovsky, Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.powx.org">Powx</a>, and one of the three researchers behind the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05193.pdf">paper</a>, shared some insights regarding the project with news.Bitcoin.com via email, detailing: &ldquo;Our first live implementation will be with a partner network that will start using OPOW Q1- Q2 2020. We&rsquo;re hoping to see broader adoption (eventually Bitcoin) after the first implementation proves the concept.&rdquo; When asked about how photonics might affect competition in the industry, and whether large mining operations wouldn&rsquo;t simply use their current energy capacity to power even more miners, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a bit counterintuitive. The additional [hardware] miners will buy with their energy savings will add some marginal energy use but if the hardware is ultra-energy efficient, you still get a huge energy savings.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a section on this in the whitepaper but we go into it in more detail in our upcoming academic paper,&rdquo; Dubrovsky elaborated. &ldquo;We will release V1 in a few months. Heavyhash is not that complicated so it doesn&rsquo;t require a massive library of code. We&rsquo;ll also publish chip design files for our prototypes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The paper describes heavyhash as a custom hash function and states: &ldquo;In its simplest form, OPOW is the Hashcash algorithm with our custom hash function, Heavyhash, designed specifically to run efficiently on optical accelerators while preserving all POW-necessary cryptographic security properties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some commenters on Dobrovsky&rsquo;s Twitter post on the subject voiced concern with a proposed changeover which, in the researcher&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeDubrovsky/status/1190316428798255104">words</a>, would be a soft fork to the existing protocol. It&rsquo;s clear that both protocol-level and economic doubts remain, including questions regarding the totally new field of competition that would presumably be created for the best photonic chip, hardware, etc. Whether or not mining could ever be democratized in the sense of helping &ldquo;the little guy&rdquo; remains to be seen, and only the future will tell if photonics can indeed bring about significant change in the bitcoin mining industry.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Blockchain Not Bitcoin</h2>
<p>When Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-chinas-new-fascination-with-blockchain-really-good-for-bitcoin/">told</a> a Politburo meeting in October that the country has to gain an edge in blockchain development, many in the People&rsquo;s Republic, and beyond, took that as a bullish statement for the whole crypto industry. But blockchain is basically a cryptographic database technology that many governments have been vowing to exploit, a part of Bitcoin but not what makes it decentralized, permissionless <a href="https://buy.bitcoin.com/">money</a>. Anyone who thought the Chinese leadership had cryptocurrencies in their plans should already know that was not really the case.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-349678 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215.jpg" alt="Crypto Employees in China Work From Home to Avoid Government Pressure" width="1000" height="490" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215-300x147.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215-768x376.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215-324x160.jpg 324w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215-533x261.jpg 533w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215-696x341.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1185692215-857x420.jpg 857w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>For example, the digital yuan China is developing will certainly not be peer-to-peer electronic cash in the sense bitcoin is, and it won&rsquo;t even be fully based on blockchain, as the Chinese have admitted. But if there&rsquo;s one thing it is likely to be, that&rsquo;s a tool allowing the Beijing government to exert greater control over money flows in what may soon be the world&rsquo;s largest economy. Decentralized cryptocurrencies are simply not compatible with the concept of sovereign money, which a major geopolitical power such as China would like to uphold, not undermine.</p>
<p>While it may be true that some Chinese projects have used the green light for blockchain development to promote their fraudulent schemes, it&rsquo;s not the scams that took the brunt of the government pressure. &ldquo;To let the average person know support for blockchain is not support for crypto, they started coming down hard on crypto,&rdquo; a source from the industry, who wished to remain anonymous, commented for news.Bitcoin.com, further adding:</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center">
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>A few companies like MXC, Whatsminer, Biki, Biss, and Binance, have been watched by the Chinese authorities. Whatsminer and Biss top management got arrested, I think. Apparently they are cracking down on crypto exchanges, targeting over 30 of them.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Reports claimed that Binance, the largest among these platforms, had its office in Shanghai closed following a police raid. And although the world&rsquo;s leading crypto exchange rejected them, denying it had a permanent office in the Chinese metropolis, few in the industry believe that the company, which maintains presence in numerous jurisdictions like Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malta, doesn&rsquo;t have an operation in mainland China.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Pressure on Binance Scares Many</h2>
<p>On Monday, Twitter commentator @DoveyWan shared a report by a Shanghai TV channel about the Binance office shut down. &ldquo;It quoted both original news and Binance&rsquo;s response of the fake news,&rdquo; she said. The report also clarified what Binance&rsquo;s office in Shanghai actually was. According to the TV station, it&rsquo;s an outsourced customer representative team operating under an entity called Babi Finance which, as the <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1198940939898642433">tweet</a> claims, is a Binance investment. Another Asian source contacted by news.Bitcoin.com commented:</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center">
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Apparently, the Shanghai Binance crackdown really scared a lot of people there. Crypto workers aren&rsquo;t going to their offices anymore. They&rsquo;re cracking down in Shanghai and Shenzhen, especially on crypto exchanges. Employees in China are working from cafes or their homes.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Bitsoda, another Chinese crypto exchange, also closed down. &ldquo;This week many companies are operating remotely. It&rsquo;s a stopgap measure,&rdquo; the industry source added. Besides, not only Shanghai and Shenzhen have been under government pressure. Noting that around 40 crypto exchanges have been visited by the authorities for allegedly breaking the established rules, the Sohu news outlet <a href="https://m.sohu.com/a/355458279_260616/?pvid=000115_3w_a">reported</a> last week that that the Beijing police had raided the office of the trading platform Biss and arrested dozens of suspects.</p>

<p>The message Beijing is sending is clear. And if someone has forgotten, an order issued by seven government regulators back in 2017, including the People&rsquo;s Bank of China, effectively banned cryptocurrency trading platforms and coin offering projects from the mainland. Not all exchanges have suffered equally in the latest crackdown, however. While Binance has been targeted, other major players have reportedly been spared. According to the source acquainted with the situation on the ground, companies with ties to the government are doing fine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably a temporary thing,&rdquo; the source remarked, but &ldquo;In China you need to have connections to operate safely.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Coinbase Granted Patent</h2>
<p>The new <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=Coinbase&OS=Coinbase&RS=Coinbase">patent</a> for Coinbase&rsquo;s &ldquo;Self-learning compliance determination and enforcement platform&rdquo; was filed on Sept. 21, 2016 and was granted just over three years later, last week, on Nov. 19. The patent details that &ldquo;The compliance model core includes a factor entering module, a compliance score model, a comparator, and a flagging unit,&rdquo; and will review user account details including but not limited to: age, &ldquo;due diligence,&rdquo; balance, transaction volumes, geographical location, previous reviews, if and how a user has verified identity, email domain, number of addresses, &ldquo;number of bitcoin addresses transacted with,&rdquo; number of bank accounts, IPs, phone numbers, verification attempts, and &ldquo;the other party in the transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patent describes an enforcement mechanism, noting: &ldquo;the user accounts that fail compliance are flagged to indicate non-compliant accounts &hellip; corrective action is executed only for the accounts that are flagged as non-compliant accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If and when Coinbase intends to implement the newly patented system is unknown. While KYC and AML requirements and enforcement are the norm in mainstream crypto exchange these days, some seemingly arbitrary factors to be calculated by AI, such as &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; are a cause for concern in those questioning the merits of such systems. Not to mention the sheer level of personal and private details to be examined.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Crypto Space Expresses Misgivings About the System</h2>
<p>Redditor u/Zinclepto addresses the Coinbase patent in a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e34f0w/kyc_measures_in_this_space_are_extreme_and_beyond/?utm_source=ifttt">post</a> writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>KYC measures in this space are extreme and beyond what&rsquo;s required by law. Where does the line get drawn?</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues: &ldquo;At what point do people stand for privacy anymore? These measures take control away from individuals and give them to financial establishments whose goals are self serving. Do people just simply not care about individual liberties anymore? If people do care, why are we collectively being so silent while this occurs?&rdquo; Another Redditor says &ldquo;Reported to authorities if the transaction is more than 2k? Wow that can&rsquo;t be serious,&rdquo; addressing a focal point in the patent that details:</p>
<blockquote><p>&hellip;the investigator also determines whether the transaction that has resulted in non-compliance is larger than $2000 USD (a predetermined amount). If the transaction is larger than $2000 USD, the investigator &hellip; considers filing a report with the relevant authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other commenters call for permissionless, <a href="http://local.bitcoin.com">peer-to-peer</a> trading privately, while still others question the very legality of the proposed practices. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do business with conbase. Find another exchange,&rdquo; one user replies.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">KYC/AML Worldwide</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of ever-constricting KYC and AML requirements is not limited to Coinbase, however, and as regulations on crypto are still vague and lack uniformity in many political jurisdictions, exchanges are pressured to adhere to the strictest interpretations of laws possible to legally protect themselves. The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) continues to exercise great influence over the crypto space, since the release of its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-global-standards-crypto-assets/">new guidance</a> in June, and governments have little choice but to begin implementations to adhere to prescribed policies.</p>
