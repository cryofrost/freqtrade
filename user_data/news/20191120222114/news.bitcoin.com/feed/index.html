On November 15, former Bitpay developer Jason Dreyzehner revealed his recurring payments system for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> called Cashchannels. A few days later, on November 18, Karol Trzeszczkowski published a plugin for Electron Cash that allows a user to create a simple escrow contract.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cashchannels</h2>
<p>Every week there seems to be something new introduced to the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> community from software developers looking to leverage the peer-to-peer electronic cash system. On Friday developer Jason Dreyzehner announced a project he&rsquo;s been working on called <a href="https://gist.github.com/bitjson/ca13abf369b5ecace6437cb86afa331f">Cashchannels</a>, which is a tool that lets users pre-approve future transactions, valued in any currency, to another person or company. Dreyzehner&rsquo;s announcement highlights that the project bolsters &ldquo;noncustodial, privacy-preserving, flexibly-denominated recurring payments.&rdquo; Essentially, once the spender authorizes a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> payment and after a specific amount of time, a &ldquo;receiver can create the transaction without the spender having to open their wallet.&rdquo; Dreyzehner added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Cashchannels automatically ensure the payment is correct, and spenders have full control over their money at all times.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Dreyzehner is also known for working on the identity and message infrastructure called <a href="https://bitauth.com/">Bitauth</a>. The software engineer has created a first draft of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/bitjson/ca13abf369b5ecace6437cb86afa331f">Cashchannels authentication template</a> and by using the Bitauth IDE, users can examine every script used by the template. Dreyzehner noted that SLP transactions can&rsquo;t use the template unless the user modifies the template to support reading SLP-based channel outputs. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested in adding Cashchannels to your wallet, have ideas for improving or optimizing the template, or if you have other questions or suggestions, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/bitjson">find me on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://gist.github.com/bitjson/ca13abf369b5ecace6437cb86afa331f">comment on the Gist</a>,&rdquo; Dreyzehner&rsquo;s announcement concluded.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Simple Escrow Smart Contract Plugin</h2>
<p>After Dreyzehner introduced Cashchannels, software developer Karol Trzeszczkowski revealed a new <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> <a href="https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Electron-Cash-Simple-Escrow-Plugin">simple escrow contract plugin</a> for <a href="https://electroncash.org">Electron Cash (EC)</a>. Trzeszczkowski also worked on a recurring payment smart contract plugin similar to Dreyzehner&rsquo;s concept called <a href="https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Mecenas-recurring-payment-EC-plugin#contract-details">Mecenas</a>. The software developer designed the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/last-will-platform-allows-your-loved-ones-to-inherit-your-bch/">Last Will</a> plugin for EC and another plugin called the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/developer-creates-interwallet-transfer-plugin-to-strengthen-bitcoin-cash-privacy/">Interwallet Transfer</a> as well. The latest simple escrow smart contract plugin specifications on Github state:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>The plugin that lets you make a simple escrow smart contract that require only normal &ldquo;bitcoincash:q&hellip;&rdquo; addresses and no awkward xpub exchange ritual.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>On Reddit, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> community enjoyed the latest plugin release from Trzeszczkowski and complimented him on his work. The forum user &lsquo;Shadow of Harbringer&rsquo; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dxs7nk/simple_escrow_electron_cash_plugin_allowing_to/f7xs19e/">wrote</a>: &ldquo;So much developments in Bitcoin Cash,&rdquo; while other Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dxs7nk/simple_escrow_electron_cash_plugin_allowing_to/">discussed</a> how the plugin &ldquo;allows [an average user] to make a 2-of-3 multi-signature in a standard wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When one person asked if the simple escrow contract plugin &ldquo;can be trusted,&rdquo; the software developer who helped Trzeszczkowski, Imaginary Username <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dxs7nk/simple_escrow_electron_cash_plugin_allowing_to/f7vwk8e/">replied</a>: &ldquo;We did quite a bit of tests (on mainnet), so far no money was lost and everything arrived at intended destinations.&rdquo; On Wednesday November 20, Trzeszczkowski also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dz6sq7/new_mecenas_plugin_release_featuring_three_new/">announced</a> his <a href="https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Mecenas-recurring-payment-EC-plugin/releases">Escrow Mecenas</a> that features three new contract versions using the Simple Escrow scheme. Overall <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> fans are pleased with the developments announced recently and both announcements from Dreyzehner and Trzeszczkowski this week were welcomed by avid supporters.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cash Games Players Get Dozens of New Options</h2>
<p><a href="http://cashgames.bitcoin.com/home/?cma=20191119_newsarticle">Cash Games</a>, Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s online gaming platform, has recently been releasing a whole range of new games, thanks to successful partnerships with leading companies in the industry. More than fifty new options have been added to the roster since early October, with even more on the way.</p>
<p>The recently released games are developed by popular providers from the online gaming industry such as Bgaming, Belatra, and Mr. Slotty. Many of the new options are based on game mechanics from that very popular casino attraction &mdash; the slot machine. The platform also offers a diverse range of other fun-to-play games and even has a stylized minesweeper for players to wager on.</p>

A $200 million fund will empower developers to offer new capabilities to bitcoin cash users as well as give institutional investors a chance to capitalize on the future of the cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">$200 Million Investment Fund</h2>
<p>Bitcoin.com is planning to launch a $200 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> investment fund in 2020 that will focus on payment related solutions and non-custodial financial services for Bitcoin Cash. The fund will invest in and incubate businesses like payment gateways, processors remittances, wallet and merchant acquirers.</p>
<p>Details of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Ecosystem Investment Fund are not yet finalized but it will allow for other institutional investors to join the fund. Backers will then be presented with a portfolio of Bitcoin Cash payment related businesses to invest in. A dedicated landing page for projects to submit their business plans will be launched very soon.</p>
<p>Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust has been screening institutional investment companies and has identified up to 20 that align with the company&rsquo;s vision and satisfy its stringent due diligence requirements. Bitcoin.com would charge a fee helping institutional investors manage the fund, on top of the fees to access the underlying payment businesses. Institutions are said to be very interested in investing alongside Roger Ver and Bitcoin.com, taking a share in the upside of future <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are super excited to launch the $200 million ecosystem fund that will rapidly scale up Bitcoin Cash focused businesses,&rdquo; stated Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust. &ldquo;Bitcoin.com receives between 6 to 8 business plans every day from software entrepreneurs leveraging the unique features and capabilities of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Bitcoin.com now has the resources and team to support these <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> entrepreneurs, grow the value of their businesses and spread bitcoin cash adoption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver added: &ldquo;There is so much great infrastructure and businesses being built in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem every day. Bitcoin.com is going to accelerate the development with our million-dollar ecosystem investment fund.&rdquo; He recently presented the idea to the community in a Bitcoin Cash Meetup in London.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Promoting the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Bitcoin.com is strongly promoting the adoption of Bitcoin Cash as peer-to-peer electronic money as well as the development of the surrounding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> ecosystem. Recently the electronics manufacturer HTC added native bitcoin cash support to its flagship smartphone, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/htc-adds-native-bitcoin-cash-support-to-its-flagship-smartphone/">Exodus 1</a>, following a partnership with the company. And it is in discussions about listing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-futures-expected-to-open-up-us-market-by-q1-2020/">bitcoin cash futures contract</a> on a new exchange with approval from the U.S. CFTC, which is expected to reach the market by the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The company also supports the adoption of the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), a token system for the Bitcoin Cash network allowing anyone to create tokens in a permissionless manner. The protocol has helped the development of an ecosystem for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCH</a> that replicates the variety of ERC20 tokens on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> network. This is one of the reasons the company launched Bitcoin.com Exchange in September, giving projects a platform for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/universal-protocol-alliance-to-list-mega-utility-token-on-bitcoin-com-exchange/">listing their SLP tokens</a>. Moreover, Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s suite of <a href="https://developer.bitcoin.com/">developer tools</a> has been downloaded more than 36,000 times from over 100 countries. The team even helps with the organization of many local <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-to-host-citys-first-bitcoin-cash-meetup-on-saturday/">BCH meetups</a> around the world.</p>

While the oft-cited candidates are many, there&rsquo;s something special about avid runner, cypherpunk and early Bitcoin contributor Harold Thomas Finney II, better known simply as Hal, that makes people want to believe he&rsquo;s the one. All wishful thinking aside, though, an examination of the facts is illuminating.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Caltech and Crypto Beginnings</h2>
<p>Finney graduated from world-renowned Caltech with an engineering degree in 1979. After working in computer game development for some years he then went on join the <a href="http://www.pgp.com">PGP Corporation</a>, creating some of the first &ldquo;pretty good privacy&rdquo; the world had seen. Finney was an OG <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">cypherpunk</a>, a member of the early 90s <a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/09/hal-finney-cpunks-1992.htm">mailing list</a> and avid developer and philosopher when it came to crypto solutions for preserving privacy, anonymity and financial autonomy.</p>
<p>Among his pre-Bitcoin accomplishments are the creation of the first known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_remailer#Cypherpunk_remailers.2C_also_called_Type_I">anonymous remailer</a> and a 2004 reusable proofs of work (RPOW) digital cash system. He also famously received the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eight-historic-bitcoin-transactions/">first ever bitcoin transaction</a> directly from Satoshi. These basic facts are impressive enough, but it stands to take a more detailed look at some coincidences and other nuggets that could shed light on whether there&rsquo;s truly a case to be made for Hal as Nakamoto. First though, a quote from Finney via a 1992 cypherpunks email:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more centralization &ndash; and Chaum offers a completely different direction to go in, one which puts power into the hands of individuals rather than governments and corporations. The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Other Intriguing Finney Facts</h2>
<p><strong>Libertarian Leanings</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-346286 size-full" title="The Many Facts Pointing to Hal Being Satoshi" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-anarchy.jpg" alt="The Many Facts Pointing to Hal Being Satoshi" width="900" height="579" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-anarchy.jpg 900w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-anarchy-300x193.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-anarchy-768x494.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-anarchy-696x448.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-anarchy-653x420.jpg 653w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p>
<p>As a cypherpunk, Finney expressed many libertarian and anarchic views regarding individual freedom. Analysis of Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s correspondence, the Bitcoin whitepaper, and the famously hashed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-years-ago-bitcoins-genesis-block-changed-the-course-of-history/">genesis block message</a> may hint at Satoshi possessing similar convictions. In one 2010 <a href="https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshi-and-laszlo-hanec-correspondence/">email</a> to Laszlo Hanecz, of 10,000-bitcoin pizza fame, Nakamoto expresses hesitancy about GPU mining outcompeting CPU users, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>GPUs would prematurely limit the incentive to only those with high end GPU hardware &hellip; I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like a socialist, I don&rsquo;t care if wealth is concentrated, but for now, we get more growth by giving that money to 100% of the people than giving it to 20%.</p></blockquote>
<p>As libertarian anarchists are typically individualist and opposed to socialism, this is a noteworthy statement from Satoshi.</p>

<p>Finney was famously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140326104029/http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/25/satoshi-nakamotos-neighbor-the-bitcoin-ghostwriter-who-wasnt/#42e4aeba4a37">discovered</a> to have lived just blocks away from a real life Satoshi Nakamoto in small town Temple City, CA; a Japanese-American man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Though Newsweek <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/face-behind-bitcoin-247957.html">quoted</a> Dorian as saying &ldquo;I am no longer involved in that [Bitcoin] and I cannot discuss it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been turned over to other people,&rdquo; Nakamoto has since issued a statement emphasizing his denial of the explosive Newsweek hound piece, noting: &ldquo;I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report.&rdquo; He also <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1086207/Dorian-Nakamoto-denies-Newsweek-claim-founder-Bitcoin.html">explained</a> that due to previous work contract stipulations, he was not at liberty to speak about any past projects, and thus the misunderstanding in Newsweek&rsquo;s assumption he meant Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Some zealous Satoshi hunters theorize Finney may have used Dorian as an inspirational pseudonym of sorts, to honor the humble and financially embattled California coder who noted in his official statement: &ldquo;I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for ten years. I have worked as a laborer, polltaker, and substitute teacher. I discontinued my internet service in 2013 due to severe financial distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hal Finney was one of the first ever people to show genuine interest in Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s peer-to-peer cash proposal, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0">noting</a> that &ldquo;When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. I was more positive.&rdquo; He was also probably the first person other than Satoshi to run bitcoin. Real-life distance runner Hal <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988?lang=en">tweeted</a> famously all the way back in January 2009: &ldquo;Running bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Mysterious Initials and Nick Szabo</strong></p>

<p>In one notable <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/finneynakamotoemails.pdf">email</a> to Finney, Nakamoto writes:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>I just thought of something. Eventually there&rsquo;ll be some interest in brute force scanning bitcoin addresses to find one with the first few characters customized to your name, kind of like getting a phone number that spells out something. Just by chance I have my initials.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bitcoin address Satoshi is referring to is his own, in the message, and it is 1NSwywA5Dvuyw89sfs3oLPvLiDNGf48cPD &mdash; the first two letters being &ldquo;NS.&rdquo; There are a couple things that have sparked intrigue for Satoshi sleuths here. For one, Japanese names are traditionally stated and written with family names first, so the guy known as Satoshi Nakamoto in the U.S. would be called Nakamoto Satoshi (NS) in Japan. However, based on Nakamoto&rsquo;s fluid English writing style and immaculate grammar &mdash; not to mention non-typically Japanese <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37743.0">sleep schedule</a> &mdash; there is doubt as to why the otherwise &ldquo;Westernized&rdquo; Bitcoin creator would point to initials in the Japanese order. Perhaps Finney was familiar with this aspect of the culture and, writing to himself as Satoshi, let it slip out.</p>
<p>Some think the initials stand for &ldquo;Nick Szabo,&rdquo; another early cypherpunk, creator of the Bit Gold <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-people-who-might-be-satoshi-nakamoto/">forerunner to Bitcoin</a>, and contemporary of Finney who corresponded with him <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0">extensively</a>. While this theory might seem to point to Szabo, and not Finney, as Satoshi, some Satoshi hunters view the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin as a group project of sorts, comprising two or more actors.</p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous Retirement</strong></p>
<p>Hal Finney retired from the PGP Corporation in early 2011. Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s last known email correspondence is dated April 26, 2011. Writing to developer Gavin Andresen after having effectively turned the Bitcoin project over to his leadership, Satoshi <a href="https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshis-final-email-to-gavin-andresen/">states</a>: &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors; it helps motivate them.&rdquo; Andresen replied, informing Satoshi he&rsquo;d been invited to speak at an event <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-final-messages-leave-tantalizing-clues-to-his-disappearance/">connected with the CIA</a>. Nakamoto never wrote back.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Runs On</h2>
<p>Like Szabo and many others in the space, Hal Finney was deeply interested in Extropianism and cryonics, and after his untimely passing due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in August, 2014, his body was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/can-clues-to-bitcoins-earliest-mysteries-be-found-in-a-cryopreserved-brain/">cryogenically preserved</a> at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona. Just 17 days after the initial diagnosis, five years earlier, he tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just got back from 11 mile run &ndash; really treasure each one now.</p>
<p>&mdash; halfin (@halfin) <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/3476739277?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2009</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Hal Finney&rsquo;s contributions in bringing Bitcoin to where it is today can hardly be overstated. A rarity in the domain of hackers, crypto geeks and cypherpunks is Finney&rsquo;s warm spark of childlike enthusiasm and down-to-earth approachability that brought a human element to his work and legacy. Whether he is Satoshi Nakamoto, of course, remains unknown. The fact that Bitcoin is still running is undeniable.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bad News Banking</h2>
<p>Recent headlines involving major banks have showcased a fact perhaps few would like to face: when it comes to your money in the bank, the bank ultimately has the final say. Roelof Botha, former CFO of Paypal, announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/roelofbotha/status/1196234200665346048">Twitter</a> Monday that his 20-year banking relationship with Bank of America had been abruptly cut short by the institution with no reason given. One commenter <a href="https://twitter.com/bitgensteinx/status/1196274117701521408">bit back</a> at Botha by saying the same thing happened to him with Paypal, and noting the problems with both centralized institutions stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your livelihood, subject to the mood swings of unknown strangers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other news, mega bank HSBC is coming under fire with critics for supposed political motivations in closing a corporate account used to support the protest movement in Hong Kong. South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038281/hsbc-close-corporate-account-being-used-support-hong-kong">reports</a> that the Prime Management Service Ltd account has been raising funds for Spark Alliance HK, to help with legal, medical and aid services. HSBC would not comment on the individual case, but noted: &ldquo;If we spot activity differing from the stated purpose of the account, or missing information, we will proactively review all activity, which can also result in account closure.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Trouble in Other Countries</h2>
<p><strong>Lebanon </strong></p>
<p>As news.Bitcoin.com reported <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lebanese-protestors-gather-at-central-bank-as-financial-lockout-continues/">last month</a>, the banking situation in politically volatile Lebanon is not favorable. Recent local <a href="http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/266519-banks-to-reopen-tuesday-after-employees-end-strike">reports</a> confirm that lenders are re-opening after a week-long strike and a turbulent month marked by bank closure amidst unrest and demonstrations, but that limits are imposed on withdrawals. The Association of Banks in Lebanon stated Sunday that account holders will be able to withdraw $1,000 a week from accounts denominated in foreign currency. Transfers of money out of the country will be limited to &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; matters.</p>
<p>One report from international media outlet rfi <a href="http://www.rfi.fr/en/wires/20191118-banks-reopen-lebanon-after-week-long-strike">notes</a>: &ldquo;The Lebanese pound has been pegged to the US dollar at around 1,500 for two decades &hellip; But amid the deepening economic crisis, the exchange rate in the parallel market has surpassed 1,800 Lebanese pounds for every dollar.&rdquo; Authorities in Lebanon are refusing to call the new policy capital controls.</p>
<p><strong>India</strong></p>
<p>Plagued by demonetization, banking scandals, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/indian-economy-recession-demonetisation-black-money_in_5dc53e34e4b00927b231296c">cash shortages</a> and a government that doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to move when it comes to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-supreme-court-wraps-up-crypto-hearing-for-the-year/">crypto</a>, residents of India haven&rsquo;t had an easy time of things in recent years. Depositors at Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank found out the hard way that governments and centralized lending institutions cannot be fully trusted in September, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/panic-at-137-bank-branches-as-rbi-limits-withdrawals-to-1000/">severe restrictions</a> on the bank&rsquo;s 137 branches and initially limited withdrawals to a total of about $14 per account for six months. The limit was later raised slightly, but turmoil continues as protests, strikes and even reported deaths are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-crisis-spreads-in-india-deaths-strike-supreme-court-denial/">occurring</a> in the wake of the financial panic surrounding PMC and other cooperative banks.</p>
<p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/zimdollars-issued-for-first-time-in-ten-years-amidst-continued-hyperinflation/">re-emergence</a> of paper and coin Zimbabwe dollars after a decade of absence was meant to steer residents of the country away from the black market for USD and reliance on mobile payment services like Ecocash, which sellers were using to charge high premiums for access to cash. The result so far has been frustrating for some Zimbabweans, however, who are finding that the limited access to the new money (currently set at around $20 per week) is nowhere near adequate. One pensioner <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-economy/zimbabweans-get-new-banknotes-but-angered-by-withdrawal-limits-idUSKBN1XM14U">told</a> Reuters:</p>
<blockquote><p>I managed to withdraw 150 dollars but it is not enough to buy anything. The banks should do something about the limit, maybe increase it to 1,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hyperinflation and unemployment continue to wrack the struggling economy, and centralized controls on markets do not seem to be helping the situation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Crypto Allows People to Be Their Own Bank</h2>
<p>Though former U.S. President Barack Obama once famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFku1YugfS0">stated</a> of encrypted technology and cryptocurrencies that &ldquo;If in fact &hellip; government can&rsquo;t get in, then everybody&rsquo;s walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket,&rdquo; some people are beginning to see that as less of a problem and more of a good thing for society. Given the current mess of capital controls, banking restrictions and irresponsible economic policies such as QE and negative interest rates being employed globally, becoming one&rsquo;s own bank via crypto presents an alluring &mdash; if sometimes challenging &mdash; option.</p>

The regulator also revealed that it has to date approved 23 charters or licenses for firms engaged in crypto activities.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fidelity&rsquo;s New Crypto License</h2>
<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) announced Tuesday that it has granted a charter under the state&rsquo;s banking law to Fidelity Digital Asset Services LLC (FDAS) to operate as a limited liability trust company in the state of New York. The Bitlicense regulator detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>DFS has authorized FDAS to provide a virtual currency custody and execution platform, on which institutional investors and individuals can securely store, purchase, sell, and transfer bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the DFS announcement, FDAS explained, &ldquo;We look forward to making our custody and trade execution services available to firms based in New York.&rdquo; The firm added, &ldquo;We have experienced a high interest level from these firms and anticipate that their increased involvement in this industry would enable more activities and development across the spectrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-347549 aligncenter" title="NY Regulator Approves Fidelity to Launch Crypto Trading and Custody Platform" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-scaled.jpg" alt="NY Regulator Approves Fidelity to Launch Crypto Trading and Custody Platform" width="2560" height="834" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-300x98.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-1024x334.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-768x250.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-1536x500.jpg 1536w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-2048x667.jpg 2048w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-696x227.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-1392x453.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-1068x348.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-1289x420.jpg 1289w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fdas-1920x625.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;The custody and trade execution services that we provide are essential building blocks for institutional investors&rsquo; continued adoption of digital assets,&rdquo; FDAS COO Michael O&rsquo;Reilly claims. &ldquo;The designation as a New York trust company under the supervision and examination of the DFS builds on the credibility and trust we&rsquo;re establishing amongst institutions and other market participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FDAS is a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, one of the world&rsquo;s largest financial services providers with more than $7.2 trillion in client assets under administration and over 1.3 million trades processed each day, according to its website. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-crypto-custody-trading/">Established in October</a> last year, the digital asset subsidiary aims to create a full-service enterprise-grade platform for storing, trading, and servicing eligible digital assets. Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said in March that his company had been adding institutional investor clients such as hedge funds and family offices, but noted that certain aspects were still a work in progress.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">23 Approvals so Far</h2>
<p>Prior to the charter granted to Fidelity, the DFS had issued 22 others since it began approving crypto businesses in 2015. The regulator revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Including the charter granted to FDAS, to date DFS has approved 23 charters or licenses for companies engaged in virtual currency business activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last company that the DFS approved before Fidelity was Bakkt Trust Company LLC. The company was granted a charter under the state&rsquo;s banking law in August and proceeded to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-regulated-bitcoin-futures-now-live-on-major-exchange/">launch regulated bitcoin futures</a> on the NYSE.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-347550 aligncenter" title="NY Regulator Approves Fidelity to Launch Crypto Trading and Custody Platform" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyc.jpg" alt="NY Regulator Approves Fidelity to Launch Crypto Trading and Custody Platform" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyc.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyc-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyc-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyc-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyc-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Several other firms have been approved by the DFS this year to operate crypto businesses. In September, the regulator green-lighted the first gold-backed digital currency in the state. Paxos, formerly Itbit, was approved to offer three asset-backed tokens: Paxos Standard (PAX); PAX Gold, an asset-backed token pegged to gold; and BUSD, an asset-backed token pegged to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the DFS also approved Seed Digital Commodities Market, Zero Hash, Bitstamp, and Tagomi Trading this year. One company was denied, however. In April, the regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-orders-bittrex-cease-operations-approves-bitstamp/">rejected Bittrex&rsquo;s applications</a> to engage in crypto and money transmission activities in the state of New York.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mega-Utility Token to Debut Wednesday</h2>
<p>The Universal Protocol Alliance is a group of like-minded cryptocurrency companies and blockchain organizations that want to connect different digital assets in a single network. The group has identified that many users need innovative solutions to move digital assets seamlessly across different wallets, exchanges, and networks. The alliance members include Bittrex, Brave, Certik, Omisego, Blockchain at Berkeley, Uphold, and Cred.</p>
<p>Universal Protocol Token is the native token of the Universal Protocol Platform, and is the underlying utility token for the Universal Protocol ecosystem. Consumers can use it to make transactions with the additional tokens and stablecoins that Universal Protocol has released including UPUSD, UPEUR, and UPBTC. Universal Protocol Token (UPT) will debut Nov. 20, 2019 on <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com Exchange</a> as an initial exchange listing, and will be available for trading by non-U.S. persons only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Universal Protocol Token is the solution for businesses, consumers and governments large and small require solutions to digitally maneuver assets anywhere and anytime,&rdquo; said JP Thieriot, co-founder of the UP Alliance and Uphold. &ldquo;UPT will unlock tremendous value in the ecosystem and set the stage for even more innovative solutions in the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Alliance Members to Provide Special Offers</h2>
<p>Each Alliance member will provide a critical component to the ecosystem, and provide different services and discounts, including:</p>
<p><strong>Cred</strong>: Holders of UPT will earn interest on UPT and all UP tokens through Cred Earn. Holders of UPT or any UP token will also be able to collateralize UPT or any UP token to receive fiat loans. Cred is a global lending and borrowing platform serving customers in 183 countries with over $300 million of lending capital.</p>
<p><strong>Uphold</strong>: Holders of UPT will receive additional digital currency back with the launch of the Uphold debit card (up to an additional 1%) and will receive discounts on all trades performed on Uphold. Founded in 2014, Uphold has over 2 million users around the world and has traded over $5.4 billion on its digital money platform and reserve ledger.</p>

Ethereum is something you build on. At least that has long been the official narrative, with projects favoring dedicated smart contract networks over Bitcoin for spinning out dapps and second layer solutions. Like all crypto narratives, however, this one has started to shift, as projects reappraise the benefits of crafting censorship-resistant applications anchored to Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Businesses Are Issuing Tokens on SLP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses of all kinds are issuing tokens on the Bitcoin Cash network using </span><a href="https://simpleledger.cash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple Ledger Protocol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It essentially works as a simplified version of Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC20 token standard, enabling anyone to create and issue a </span><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/tokens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">native token</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a matter of minutes. Bitcoin Cash &ndash; like Bitcoin Core &ndash; is not a smart contract blockchain, and thus lacks Ethereum&rsquo;s Turing completeness, which enables the creation of tokenized systems with complex logic programmed in. Most projects don&rsquo;t need to issue a token with the sophistication of something like Maker&rsquo;s dai, however: the ability to mint and issue tokens, anchored to the security of a robust proof-of-work chain, is enough.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-337068" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-1024x690.jpg" alt="SLP Hackathon Produces a Variety of Innovative Token Ideas" width="696" height="469" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-1024x690.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-300x202.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-768x517.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-696x469.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-1392x938.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-1068x719.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-623x420.jpg 623w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-190x128.jpg 190w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-380x256.jpg 380w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99-760x512.jpg 760w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/slp99.jpg 1520w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main reasons why businesses have been building on Bitcoin Cash with SLP. The first is that they are already ideologically or pragmatically aligned with the network, possibly on account of its ultra-low fees and scalability. The other is that the shortcomings of traditional smart contract networks such as Ethereum and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a> have given them cause to seek sanctuary in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>. Ethereum&rsquo;s fees rose significantly this year, exacerbated by Tether&rsquo;s takeover of the network following <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>&rsquo;s migration to the ERC20 standard. Fears of creeping centralization on Ethereum, and the baked in centralization on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a> haven&rsquo;t helped either network either. Projects </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/slp-token-ecosystem-built-on-bitcoin-cash-continues-to-blossom/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now using</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Simple Ledger Protocol include an </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-based-electric-bike-company-launches-slp-reward-token/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric bike company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://sideshift.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sideshift.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has created a BTC-anchored token on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why RSK Is Building on Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, second layer development work is kicking into gear, with </span><a href="https://www.rsk.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most prominent company spearheading the Bitcoin building revival. CEO Diego Guti&eacute;rrez Zald&iacute;var told news.Bitcoin.com that the company favored creating a smart contract infrastructure on top of Bitcoin due to the security guarantees and developmental certainty that it yields, explaining: </span>&ldquo;A two-way peg between Smart Bitcoin (RBTC) and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> means users can access a fully smart contract-enabled environment that&rsquo;s bolstered by the proof of work from miners that secure the Bitcoin blockchain through merged-mining. Bitcoin has proved it is here to stay, and we believe it will enable an internet of value ecosystem with a very bright future.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-188036" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/RSK.png" alt="" width="300" height="172"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Recently, IOV Labs, RSK and RIF OS have increased their global reach and have taken crucial steps to introduce Bitcoin and RSK Smart Contract technologies to a wider audience,&rdquo; noted Zald&iacute;var. &ldquo;Through these steps, we expect to receive community and user feedback and to make the necessary adjustments for Bitcoin and RSK to reach more people.&rdquo; While Bitcoin&rsquo;s security model is unrivaled, convincing businesses to build upon a blockchain that is not synonymous with smart contracts requires education and demonstration of how this works in practice. To achieve this, RSK&rsquo;s parent company IOV Labs has embarked on a whirlwind global outreach effort, onboarding companies in major territories along the way. This has included partnering with NXTP, a Latin America-based accelerator, investing in three blockchain projects &ndash; </span><a href="https://vega.xyz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://multis.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://pokt.network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; and acquiring social network Taringa.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Other Blockchains Are Anchoring to Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every project is looking to issue dapps and middleware upon Bitcoin: some simply want to capitalize on its security and its neatly timestamped blocks, which can be used to anchor an array of other blockchains. Bitcoin serves as the fulcrum around which these chains revolve, effectively forming a Schelling point. Numerous projects have tapped into Bitcoin&rsquo;s security in this manner over the years, most recently </span><a href="https://www.veriblock.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veriblock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-335231" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/veriblock_logo_official-300x96.png" alt="" width="300" height="96" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/veriblock_logo_official-300x96.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/veriblock_logo_official-768x246.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/veriblock_logo_official-1024x328.png 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/veriblock_logo_official-696x223.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/veriblock_logo_official.png 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project utilizes &ldquo;proof-of-proof,&rdquo; a meta-sounding consensus mechanism that encodes proof into <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&rsquo;s OP_ Return field. Veriblock promises to deliver Bitcoin-level security for new and established blockchains, reducing the risk of double spends and 51% attacks. As Veriblock explains, Bitcoin is &ldquo;the golden standard of security&rdquo; with &ldquo;more than 40 times the thermos-equivalent computational power to the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ease of Building on Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two Bitcoins &ndash; Core and Cash &ndash; have a number of advantages for projects seeking to build upon them, over and above security. The deep liquidity that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in particular enjoys, coupled with its broad adoption, places it at an advantage over smart contract networks such as Ethereum. Bitcoin Cash, meanwhile, is very developer-friendly, with Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://developer.bitcoin.com/develop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing a complete toolkit for the purpose of launching BCH-based applications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of RSK&rsquo;s ecosystem, most of the development work occurring with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> currently revolves around Lightning Network (LN). Due to the complexity of LN, however, it is less developer-friendly than Bitcoin Cash as it stands. Once Lightning Network becomes production ready, it may spawn a cottage industry of LN-based apps (&lsquo;Lapps&rsquo;) and BTC-powered financial solutions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash will remain an attractive proposition to projects enticed by the unrivaled security provided by proof-of-work.</span></p>

However, there&rsquo;s been a lot of speculation aimed at guessing the number of &lsquo;lost coins&rsquo; that will never be spent. On November 19, the digital currency data and research site Coin Metrics published an in-depth study that estimates the true number of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&rsquo;s circulating supply.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Coin Metrics Estimates the Number of Lost Bitcoins</h2>
<p>According to various data websites, there&rsquo;s 18,056,300 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in circulation at the time of publication. This number, however, only accounts for the amount of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mined into existence and does not account for lost coins. People who love the fact that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is scarce are extremely fascinated by the subject of lost coins because in the early days many bitcoins were either lost, burned, stolen, or even forgotten. Even Satoshi explained that lost bitcoins &ldquo;make everyone else&rsquo;s coins worth slightly more&rdquo; and said to &ldquo;think of it as a donation to everyone.&rdquo; This week, researchers at <a href="https://coinmetrics.io/">Coin Metrics</a> published an analysis of how the public can use different methods to assess <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&rsquo;s true supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this feature, we dive into why Bitcoin&rsquo;s supply is lower than expected and calculate how many coins are permanently lost,&rdquo; Coin Metrics&rsquo; post states. &ldquo;Furthermore, we analyze exactly why these coins are lost, and account for what happened to them. We first examine coins that are provably lost, and then analyze coins that are assumed to be lost, but could potentially eventually be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-d2e">study</a> discusses provably lost coins like unspent outputs such as the 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> locked in the first block. &ldquo;The result is that those 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> are not present in Bitcoin&rsquo;s ledger, even if they are visible in a transaction included in the main chain,&rdquo; the researchers stress. Further, the research highlights duplicate coinbase transactions, unclaimed rewards, and OP_Return outputs that use more than a value of zero satoshis. &ldquo;In total, we can compute Bitcoin&rsquo;s actual supply at block 600,000 working backwards from the expected 18M <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> value and subtracting what is provably lost,&rdquo; the study details. &ldquo;This figure of 17,999,817 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> as of block 600,000 is the &lsquo;technically correct&rsquo; view of Bitcoin&rsquo;s supply.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Assumed Losses and Stolen Coins</h2>
<p>Following the subject of provably lost coins, the paper discusses assumed lost coins like bogus addresses, bugs in script, and &lsquo;zombie coins&rsquo; or UTXOs &ldquo;that haven&rsquo;t moved in many years.&rdquo; Lastly, the study looks at stolen coins or large numbers of coins that are &ldquo;difficult to insert back into circulation.&rdquo; A good example of this is when 79,956 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was taken from Mt. Gox exchange and the funds now rest in the sixth richest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> address. From the number of lost coins analyzed, the Coin Metrics researchers developed three adjusted views of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> protocol&rsquo;s supply. One view that counts provably lost coins, another perspective that accounts for assumed lost coins, and another that excludes provably, stolen, and assumed lost bitcoins.</p>

<p>Coin Metrics research says there are a variety of other methods that can be used to measure <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&rsquo;s true supply. &ldquo;Another way to estimate Bitcoin&rsquo;s supply would be to break it down by time of last activity with the expectation that coins untouched for years are probably lost,&rdquo; the report concludes.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Simple Ledger Postage Protocol</h2>
<p><a href="https://cointext.io/en/">Cointext</a> CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/vinarmani">Vin Armani</a> recently published a <a href="https://medium.com/@vinarmani/simple-ledger-postage-protocol-enabling-a-true-slp-token-ecosystem-on-bitcoin-cash-f960a58c16c4">blog post</a> called &ldquo;Simple Ledger Postage Protocol: Enabling A True SLP Token Ecosystem On Bitcoin Cash,&rdquo; which describes a method of sending <a href="https://simpleledger.cash">SLP-based tokens</a> without using <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> for &lsquo;gas.&rsquo; In the post, Armani says that tokens like ERC20s stemming from Ethereum have suffered from the &lsquo;dual currency&rsquo; requirement for years. Armani&rsquo;s post stresses that more recently &ldquo;similar proposals have arisen as ERC865 and EIP965&rdquo; that address the issue. But to Armani &ldquo;these solutions are quite complex and, to date, do not seem to be attracting significant interest from the overall community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cointext engineer explains that in order to move SLP tokens, a small fraction of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> is needed to push the transaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;gas&rsquo; problem all over again,&rdquo; Armani highlights. &ldquo;At least that was the case until the publication of the <a href="https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-postage-protocol.md">Simple Ledger Postage Protocol</a> (SLPP) as an official SLP specification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;[For] the sender of SLP tokens to effectuate a transaction without the need for additional native Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) inputs to cover output balance and/or miner fees,&rdquo; describes the purpose of the new SLPP specification. &ldquo;Use of this protocol enables wallets to exclusively support SLP tokens without also, simultaneously, having to act as a wallet for native <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>.&rdquo; The software engineer&rsquo;s blog post adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>In essence, the Postage Protocol allows users to pay for their miner fees using the SLP token itself. This is accomplished through the use of an intermediary server called a &ldquo;post office.&rdquo; The user sends the post office the requisite value of the needed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> as an additional output in a transaction. Upon receiving and validating the otherwise invalid transaction, the post office attaches additional input containing native <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> (&ldquo;stamps&rdquo;) and then broadcasts the &ldquo;postage paid&rdquo; (valid) transaction to the network.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tokens as First-Class Citizens Makes so Much Sense</h2>
<p>Armani notes that wallets using the SLPP system can utilize a UX where <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> for gas is never needed. This could make it so tokens, token creators and supporters can essentially &ldquo;treat their own token as a first-class citizen.&rdquo; &ldquo;With a user experience that mirrors the experience that can already be had with Bitcoin Cash when using <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>,&rdquo; Armani&rsquo;s post underlines. &ldquo;Stablecoins, utility coins, and rewards points can all be used in standalone wallets, without the user ever needing to even know that they are transacting on a Bitcoin network at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the blog post, there&rsquo;s also a <a href="https://youtu.be/IATkQEdRdVI">demonstration video</a> that shows the Simple Ledger Postage Protocol in action with <a href="https://badger.bitcoin.com/">Badger Wallet</a> and the stablecoin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/honestnode-founder-discusses-the-first-stablecoin-built-on-bitcoin-cash/">honestcoin (USDH)</a>. Moreover, Armani&rsquo;s firm Cointext is offering the first SLP post office and the system is now live. Currently, users can test the new SLPP framework with the SLP tokens honestcoin (USDH), spice token (SPICE) and anypay gold (GOLD).</p>

<p>The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> community seemed excited about Armani and Cointext&rsquo;s new SLPP idea and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> supporters discussed the idea on Reddit and Twitter. The creator of the cryptocurrencies Zclassic and Bitcoin Private, Rhett Creighton, <a href="https://twitter.com/HeyRhett/status/1196537183190028288">told</a> Armani &ldquo;this is absolutely incredible &mdash; full disclosure I&rsquo;m buying more <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> today after reading this.&rdquo; &ldquo;After reading the article it seems like eventually, you will be able to use multiple versions of &lsquo;gas&rsquo; just like USDH and probably I guess SAI and etc., (auto conversion services later I presume),&rdquo; another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/Pepehandz/status/1196546412621643776">asked</a> the Cointext founder on Twitter. &ldquo;[It] can be used with any SLP token that a post office is willing to support,&rdquo; Armani replied. &ldquo;Every few days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> surprises me with what is possible,&rdquo; a Bitcoin Cash fan <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dy98uu/you_no_longer_have_to_use_native_bch_as_gas_when/f7zkx4j/">wrote</a> in reply about the postage concept on the Reddit forum r/btc. &ldquo;Tokens as first-class citizens makes so much sense.&rdquo;</p>
