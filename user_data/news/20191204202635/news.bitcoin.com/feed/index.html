With a long history of mathematical innovation, and purportedly proving conjectures thought to be near impossible to verify, he seems to almost come from an alien world. Mochizuki further painstakingly avoids the spotlight. Some, like American computer scientist and co-inventor of hypertext, Ted Nelson, go so far as to call him Satoshi.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Coolness Outside</h2>
<p>As Paul Rosenberg states in his <a href="https://www.freemansperspective.com/be-the-outsider/">blog post</a> &ldquo;Be the Outsider,&rdquo; everything that ultimately innovates comes from a private space, on the fringes of society: &ldquo;Please believe me that the coolest things happen outside, and not within the hierarchies of the status quo &hellip; Outside is where personal computers came from. It&rsquo;s where the Internet came from. It&rsquo;s where Bitcoin came from &hellip; Nearly everything cool comes from outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki fits this unorthodox form as well. Attempting to solve &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; problems, focused only on his work and hiding from the spotlight, the 50-year-old professor Mochizuki has chosen not to submit his most revolutionary ideas for formal review. He has instead &mdash; much like Satoshi Nakamoto &mdash; surreptitiously placed them on <a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/papers-english.html">the internet</a>, and walked away.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Shinichi Stats</h2>
<p><strong>A Mathematics Prodigy</strong></p>
<p>Child of an international marriage, Mochizuki moved with his family from Japan to the United States at age five, and would go on to graduate Philips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire at age 16. From there it was Princeton University for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and Ph.D in mathematics, lecturing at Harvard for two years, and then a return to Japan in 1994. Mochizuki is currently a full professor at Japan&rsquo;s prestigious Kyoto University.</p>
<p>In spite of impressive accomplishments and accolades such as proving <a title="Anabelian geometry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabelian_geometry#Formulation_of_a_conjecture_of_Grothendieck_on_curves">Grothendieck&rsquo;s conjecture on anabelian geometry</a> in 1996, and being invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians, nothing would cause such a stir as his alleged proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture#Claimed_proofs_of_abc">ABC Conjecture</a> in 2012. The conjecture is <a href="http://projectwordsworth.com/the-paradox-of-the-proof/">described</a> as a &ldquo;beguilingly simple number theory problem that had stumped mathematicians for decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What math experts found in reviewing the proof, however, was that they couldn&rsquo;t even understand it, and Mochizuki couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to explain. Caroline Chen notes in her article The Paradox of the Proof:</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually, they said, mathematicians discuss their findings with their colleagues. Normally, they publish pre-prints to widely respected online forums. Then they submit their papers to the Annals of Mathematics, where papers are refereed by eminent mathematicians before publication. Mochizuki was bucking the trend. He was, according to his peers, &ldquo;unorthodox.&rdquo; But what roused their ire most was Mochizuki&rsquo;s refusal to lecture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like Bitcoin had been carefully dropped off as an alien creation on obscure corners of the internet at its inception, Mochizuki had dropped off a supposed bombshell in the field of mathematics and stepped back. He had even created his own terminology over a decade of isolated research which other mathematicians couldn&rsquo;t parse.</p>
<p>Chen explains: &ldquo;Then Mochizuki walked away. He did not send his work to the Annals of Mathematics. Nor did he leave a message on any of the online forums frequented by mathematicians around the world. He just posted the papers, and waited.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>An American Background in British English</strong></p>
<p>Critics of Satoshi theories placing a Japanese as Nakamoto often cite Satoshi&rsquo;s impeccable command of the English language and grammar in correspondence, and the cleanliness of his writing style. As a native speaker, this would have been a non-issue for Princeton salutatorian Mochizuki.</p>
<p>Also frequently cited is Satoshi&rsquo;s use of typically British English expressions and spellings such as &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; and &ldquo;colour.&rdquo; Interestingly, Mochizuki&rsquo;s mentor and doctoral advisor from Princeton, Gerd Faltings, is a German national. The two would have presumably communicated in English at Princeton in an academic setting, and the English formally taught in Germany is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/9foty7/when_english_is_used_in_germany_is_it_british/">typically</a> British English. Mochizuki would have also undoubtedly been exposed to the British usages at his prestigious boarding school, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Exeter_Academy">Philips Exeter Academy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hyper-Endorsement from Ted Nelson</strong></p>
<p>The inventor of hypertext, computer scientist and philosopher Ted Nelson feverishly rushed to produce an entertaining and insightful video on Mochizuki in 2013 <a href="https://qz.com/86255/the-mysterious-creator-of-bitcoin-could-be-japanese-mathematician-shinichi-mochizuki-says-the-inventor-of-hypertext/">after reading an article</a> about him and deciding that Shinichi Mochizuki was indeed &ldquo;the one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emDJTGTrEm0" width="803" height="452" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lack of Explanation and Evasion of the Spotlight</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry to be a wet blanket. Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There&rsquo;s nothing to relate it to.</p></blockquote>
<p>So read the words of Satoshi Nakamoto from a July 5, 2010 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=234.0">post</a> to Bitcointalk.org, in attempting to define Bitcoin for a wider audience. Like Bitcoin, Mochizuki&rsquo;s purported proof of the ABC Conjecture was a novel contribution not readily grasped by the public, or even experts. With a stated goal of establishing &ldquo;an arithmetic version of Teichm<span class="js-about-item-abstr">&uuml;</span>ller theory for number fields equipped with an elliptic curve &hellip; by applying the theory of semi-graphs of anabelioids, Frobenioids, the etale theta function, and log-shells,&rdquo; even the world&rsquo;s premier mathematicians were stumped, and Mochizuki couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to explain.</p>
<p>When asked by a well-known university to visit and expound on the proof, Mochizuki <a href="http://projectwordsworth.com/the-paradox-of-the-proof/">reportedly stated</a> &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly do that in one talk.&rdquo; He then refused even when offered more time. Friend and colleague of Mochizuki, Oxford professor Minhyong Kim, states that Shinichi is a &ldquo;slightly shy character,&rdquo; noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&rsquo;s a very hard working guy and he just doesn&rsquo;t want to spend time on airplanes and hotels and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-350757 size-large" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-1024x535.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="364" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-300x157.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-768x401.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-696x364.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-1068x558.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979-804x420.jpg 804w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_678354979.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></p>
<p><strong>Japanese Background</strong></p>
<p>Japanese culture is quiet, reserved, and hardworking, generally speaking. Humility and politeness go hand-in-hand with and an almost painful aversion to being the center of attention. In Japan it is viewed as graceful and appropriate to do one&rsquo;s work quietly, complete the task, and not make much of a fuss about it. This can be very different from the general Western individualist ethos, which often calls for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxk31hL1RqA">flashy attention</a> or a prize in the face of groundbreaking accomplishment.</p>
<p>On a linguistic aside, the name Shinichi means &ldquo;new one&rdquo; in Japanese, and interestingly shares a syllable count with Satoshi. The surnames line up syllabically as well, but this could be nothing more than mere coincidence.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Skepticism and Summary</h2>
<p>The most obvious argument against Shinichi Mochizuki being Satoshi Nakamoto is a glaring lack of known background in computers, coding, and cypherpunk ethos and knowledge. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine though, that a scholar of his caliber in the field of mathematics would not have at least some working familiarity with these fields. Critics have pulled no punches in attempting to put the Mochizuki as Satoshi theory into the cultural paper shredder, even <a href="https://pando.com/2013/05/21/the-case-against-shinichi-mochizuki-as-bitcoins-dance-away-genius/">leveraging insult</a> to do so. Still, like the other candidates in this series so far, Mochizuki merits examination on a variety of counts, and further adds to the mystery of the hunt for Bitcoin&rsquo;s pseudonymous creator.</p>

<p>The key features of blockchain technology &ndash; such as immutability of the chain, low fees, and smart contracts that allow to conclude deals without an intermediary &ndash; created a high demand for blockchain developments in the crypto world and beyond it. The scalability issue, though, has been holding the technology back for years. In order to find a solution, blockchain developers tried numerous approaches to it, including but not limited to increasing the block size, distributing data between servers in shards, or storing data off-chain. However, all of these approaches ended up compromising the other two pillars of blockchain: security or decentralization.</p>
<p>ILCoin first entered the market in 2015, introducing ILC cryptocurrency. Today, ILCoin Blockchain Project is more than a crypto: it focuses on solving the most pressing problems of the industry, increasing blockchain&rsquo;s usability, and finding a way to create a viable on-chain data storage solution. For ILCoin Development team, 2019 was marked with two considerable breakthroughs. At the beginning of the year, the project presented a hacker-proof C2P consensus, which boosted the network&rsquo;s security to an unprecedented level. This November, ILCoin released RIFT protocol aimed at resolving the scalability issue.</p>
<p>With their new development, ILCoin reconsiders the basics of blockchain, placing the main principles devised by Satoshi Nakamoto on a brand new technological base that meets the modern demand. RIFT protocol features two layers of blocks: standard blocks and mini-blocks, which contain transactions.</p>
<p>Unlike standard blocks, mini-blocks are not mined but generated by the system, giving the network unlimited potential for scalability. Mini-blocks are interconnected by references and connected to their parent blocks, ensuring that the data stays intact. In addition to its unique structure, RIFT also introduces simultaneous asynchronization &ndash; a new mechanism that carries out parallel sync of individual blocks and prevents network congestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;RIFT protocol disrupts the very concept of blockchain: mainly with the idea that simultaneous asynchronization is, in fact, technically possible. With RIFT, we are able to solve both the FIFO and the bottleneck problems and manage large blocks at unprecedented speed,&rdquo; &ndash; explained Norbert Goffa, the Executive Manager of ILCoin.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the case of a 5 Gb block size, 3-minute block generation time, and 232 bytes transaction weight, RIFT demonstrated an effective transaction speed of 23 140 987 tx/block. According to the developers, the only limit to this technology is the current network capacities.</p>
<p>In order to integrate the new code into the system, ILCoin Blockchain Project performed a hard fork, which was shortly followed by the release of enhanced blocks. Since the end of November, 5Gb blocks are available in the live net as the <a href="http://ilcoinexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real proof</a> that the scalability problem is solved for good. At the moment, ILCoin&rsquo;s ecosystem is returning to full functioning, and ILC transactions are gradually being resumed, as most exchanges have already implemented the new code.</p>
<p>With its outstanding characteristics, RIFT marks the beginning of a new era for the whole blockchain industry. It is the first solution in the market, which is able to maintain high efficiency within large-scale networks and create a solid foundation for cost-effective on-chain storage.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sofi Receives New York Bitlicense</h2>
<p>It was announced on Tuesday that the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) has approved the application of Sofi Digital Assets, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Social Finance, Inc., for virtual currency and money transmitter licenses. The two licenses will allow Sofi to offer its New York clients the ability to buy and sell digital assets. The company now is authorized to support the cryptocurrencies bitcoin core (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), ether classic (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a>), litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>), and stellar lumens (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting our members&rsquo; interests first is our top priority at Sofi,&rdquo; said Anthony Noto, the CEO of the company. &ldquo;That includes both offering individuals the products they want, like cryptocurrency within Sofi Invest, as well as protecting them, through a solid regulatory framework like that created by the New York State Department of Financial Services. We&rsquo;re thrilled to now be able to offer the trading of cryptocurrency, in addition to active and automated investing, as part of Sofi Invest in New York State, in addition to the full suite of Sofi products that help our members borrow, save, spend, invest, and protect their money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A New York Bitlicense is considered one of the hardest in the world for companies to receive. This greatly limits the ability of local residences to engage with unlicensed ventures as only companies that can withstand the long and costly procedure even apply. Since 2015, DFS has granted only 24 virtual currency licenses or trust charters, including the last one given to Sofi on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DFS is committed to fostering innovation in New York&rsquo;s vibrant virtual currency sector and ensuring its competitiveness as a market for new entrants,&rdquo; said Financial Services Superintendent Linda A. Lacewell. &ldquo;The Department&rsquo;s approval of Sofi&rsquo;s virtual currency and money transmitter licenses provides consumers with more choices in a continuously evolving global financial services marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">$4 Billion Online Finance Startup</h2>
<p>Sofi is a San Francisco-based fintech company founded in August 2011 and already valued at about $4.3 billion as of earlier this year. Its offering is focusing on providing millennials with student loan refinancing, personal loans, mortgages, and other wealth management and financial services. Sofi raised capital funding to a total of $2.3 billion with help from major investors such as the Japanese conglomerate Softbank and the Qatar Investment Authority.</p>
<p>In February 2019, it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/in-the-daily-fidelity-investments-london-stock-exchange-group-sofi/">reported</a> that Sofi was planning to enter the crypto-assets market by enabling its users to follow and buy coins via a partnership with the U.S. exchange Coinbase. In September the company announced that it has added crypto trading to its fast-growing Sofi Invest platform, as a response to demand from its over 800,000 members. Sofi Invest now offers automated and active investing with stocks, ETFs, and crypto through a single app.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feedback from our members has made it clear that a significant percentage are not only interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies but are also already buying and selling crypto,&rdquo; said at the time Sofi CEO Anthony Noto. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very pleased to be adding this new product to Sofi Invest, as access, education, and keeping costs low for our members is at the heart of what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Unicredit Eliminating 8000 Jobs</h2>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s largest bank, Unicredit, unveiled its new business plan to 2023 on Tuesday, which reportedly includes laying off 8,000 employees and closing 500 branches. CEO Jean Pierre Mustier claims that this round of job cuts will help eliminate 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) of the bank&rsquo;s gross expenses.</p>
<p>Unicredit also announced a separate buyback of 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion), Bloomberg detailed, noting that the job cuts equal to more than 9% of the bank&rsquo;s workforce. The bank, however, said it intends to spend 9.4 billion euros on information technology and human resources over the next four years to update its technology and improve compliance.</p>

Its 14 core markets are Italy, Germany, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Two Italian banking unions told Reuters on Tuesday that they expect the actual number of job cuts to be around 5,500 instead of the 8,000 announced. They also expect 450 branches to close instead of the planned 500 branches.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Banks Cutting Over 75,700 Jobs Worldwide</h2>
<p>The job cut announcement by Unicredit brings the total number of layoffs announced by banks globally this year to 75,700, according to Bloomberg. 83% of these banks are in Europe where negative interest rates and slowing economies have forced financial institutions to cut costs. In September, news.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/massive-layoffs-banks-cutting-nearly-60000-jobs-worldwide/">reported</a> that the number of announced job cuts totaled over 60,000.</p>

<p>Overall, banks in Europe have announced job cuts of 63,036, representing more than 10 times the total number announced by banks in North America, the news outlet conveyed. In Europe, banks in Germany top the list of major job cuts. Deutsche Bank leads the pack with a plan to lay off 18,000 employees through 2022 as it scales down its investment banking business. Besides cutting jobs, banks in Germany are passing on the burden of negative interest rates to their clients. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/survey-58-of-german-banks-charge-negative-interest-rates/">recent survey</a> by the German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, shows that 58% of banks surveyed are already doing so. Some are charging all savers negative interest rates while others only target wealthy and corporate clients.</p>
<p>According to data compiled by Bloomberg, other banks with major layoff plans include Banco Santander which is cutting 5,400 jobs, Commerzbank 4,300 jobs, HSBC 4,000 jobs, Barclays 3,000 jobs, Alfa Bank 3,000 jobs, KBC 2,100 jobs, Societe Generale 2,100 jobs, and Caixabank 2,000 jobs. HSBC may actually be laying off more workers as the company said in October that it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banking-giant-hsbc-set-to-fire-10000-more-employees/">may cut up to 10,000 jobs</a>.</p>

A new report reveals that financial institutions across the region faced serious difficulties in the 2018 financial year, and despite all the cost cutting that followed, haven&rsquo;t managed to compensate the revenue decline in 2019. Historically low interest rates, new regulatory hurdles and competition from U.S. banks have all added to the hardship. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Corporate and Investment Banks See Declining Revenues</h2>
<p>The financial industry in Europe is facing some fundamental constraints such as cost inelasticity, revenue decline and talent evasion. The European CIB Outlook 2019, a study published recently by the consulting firm Eurogroup Consulting, is centered on how the continent&rsquo;s corporate and investment banks (CIS) can address these challenges.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-350789 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1451573282.jpg" alt="European Banks Struggle With Low Interest Rates and Strict Regulations" width="1000" height="511" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1451573282.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1451573282-300x153.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1451573282-768x392.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1451573282-696x356.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_1451573282-822x420.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Other threats they have to deal with stem from the economic and regulatory environment, which has been deteriorating. These include interest rates that have reached historic lows, new stringent regulations requiring compliance and increased market volatility. European banks had to make infrastructure investments while being forced to significantly reduce spending at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, &ldquo;In FY 2018, a large majority of European CIBs experienced negative Jaws.&rdquo; In finance, the &lsquo;jaws ratio&rsquo; is an indicator measuring the difference between income growth rate and expenses growth rate.</p>
<p>During the 2018 financial year, overall CIB revenues grew by 3.5%. The upward movement was catalyzed mainly by equity and prime services as well as a favorable exchange rate, the authors of the study note. By the first quarter of 2019, however, equities and prime businesses had fallen by 21.6%. That caused a 10% year-over-year drop in operating revenues. The report concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center">
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Cost reduction programmes have struggled to keep pace with top line decline, combined with increased volatility in the market and unprecedently low interest rates.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Digitalization Offers a Way Out</h2>
<p>Eurogroup Consulting points out that the study has assessed how European CIBs can bridge the performance gap with U.S. banks, which have been able to strengthen their position abroad thanks to two main factors &ndash; a stronger domestic market and more favorable regulatory landscape. Corporate and investment banks on the Old Continent should consider structural changes, the consulting firm says, in order to address the fundamental constraints they are facing.</p>
<p>European banks must focus on asset industrialization, for instance, aiming to achieve a return on equity (RoE) increase of between 2 and 4%. They can also gain from structured finance opportunities with revenue growth leading to RoE improvement of around 2 to 3%. Last but not least, talent empowerment can get them a RoE expansion of up to 2%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-350790 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/roe.jpg" alt="European Banks Struggle With Low Interest Rates and Strict Regulations" width="694" height="357" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/roe.jpg 694w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/roe-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px"></p>
<p>One the main goals of the report is to seek ways for European CIBs to optimize their costs and re-energize their talent, as the authors put it. Quite naturally, in a time of rapid digital transformation one of the paths to achieving that is through &ldquo;digitalization, whereby digital initiatives will only be successful by aligning their strategy to the scale of disruption and maturity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disruption and maturity is actually what some European countries and their banks have been demonstrating. In <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/defying-crypto-winter-swiss-crypto-valley-grows-to-750-companies/">Switzerland</a>, whose crypto valley has become home to over 700 companies, traditional banks have started to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swiss-banks-team-with-fintechs-to-enter-the-crypto-space/">team up</a> with fintechs to offer cutting edge digital services. And the Swiss government recently <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-77252.html">presented</a> a set of wide-ranging proposals to update its banking, corporate and financial infrastructure laws to accommodate the digital asset industry.</p>
<p>Or take Germany as another example, where <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/german-banks-authorized-to-store-and-sell-cryptocurrency-in-2020/">new legislation</a> is going to allow banks to receive, store, and sell cryptocurrencies starting from next year. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitwala-bank-bitcoin-wallet-debit-card/">partnership</a> between a crypto platform and a local bank there already offers clients the chance to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly from their bank account, which comes with an integrated bitcoin wallet. Besides, a growing number of companies, such as <a href="https://earn.mycred.io/bitcoin">Cred</a> for instance, provide global banking services tailored to the specific needs of crypto users.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lastroots: the 21st Approved Exchange</h2>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) approved the only remaining &ldquo;deemed cryptocurrency exchange&rdquo; last week. Lastroots has become the 21st FSA-approved crypto exchange operator in the country. Deemed cryptocurrency exchanges were those in business prior to April 2017 when Japan&rsquo;s amended Fund Settlement Law and the amended Payment Services Act went into effect. The new law <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-bitcoin-method-payment-april-1/">legalizes cryptocurrency</a> as a means of payment and requires exchange operators to register with the FSA.</p>
<p>Established on June 2, 2016, Lastroots launched a cryptocurrency exchange in March 2017. Six months later, on Sept. 27, the Tokyo-based company applied for registration alongside other exchange operators, such as Bitflyer. However, while the FSA approved several others, it held onto Lastroots&rsquo; application until now. On April 6, 2018, the company received a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/two-crypto-exchanges-suspended-by-japans-financial-regulator/">business improvement order</a> from the regulator. In the same month, it became a subsidiary of Okwave Co. Ltd., one of Japan&rsquo;s largest social Q&A communities.</p>

<p>With 49 employees, Lastroots currently engages in the crypto exchange business as well as business development using blockchain technology. Its crypto exchange, C0ban, allows customers to trade the C0ban token (RYO) against the yen. According to Lastroot&rsquo;s website, the C0ban exchange aims to list &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s most promising ICOs.&rdquo; So far, Lastroots only supports the trading of RYO according to the FSA&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>The company plans to offer a payment and remittance service. &ldquo;We will develop simple remittance solutions both in Japan and overseas,&rdquo; the company explained. &ldquo;In particular, international remittances currently require extremely high fees, but we will lower the cost to the limit and aim for creating infrastructure for people in emerging countries such as Asia.&rdquo; Lastroots is a member of two crypto associations in Japan: the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association and the Japan Virtual currency Business Association.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">20 Other Registered Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p>A few months after Japan legalized cryptocurrency as a means of payment, the FSA began approving crypto exchanges. Including Lastroots, 21 have been registered in total. The first 11 exchange operators were registered on Sept. 29, 2017. They were Money Partners, Quoine, Bitflyer, Bitbank, SBI VC Trade, GMO Coin, Huobi Japan (formerly Bittrade), Btcbox, Bitpoint Japan, Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange, and Tech Bureau. Tech Bureau was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fisco-japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-zaif/">acquired</a> by Fisco after it was hacked in September last year. However, the two platforms continue to operate independently and are still listed on the FSA website as two separate crypto exchanges.</p>

<p>On Dec. 1, 2017, DMM Bitcoin, Taotao (formerly Bitarg), Bitgate, and Xtheta were registered. Bitocean followed suit on Dec. 26. No operator was registered in 2018, largely due to the January <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coincheck-start-compensating-hack-victims-resume-operations/">hack of Coincheck</a>, one of the country&rsquo;s largest crypto trading platforms. The FSA subsequently tightened its oversight of the industry including conducting on-site inspections of exchanges.</p>
<p>In June 2018, there were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-reject-cryptocurrency-exchange/">16</a> deemed crypto exchange operators in Japan. Two months later, only three were left after the FSA tightened its oversight of the industry, the regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchanges-japanese-market/">confirmed</a> to news.Bitcoin.com at the time. The three were Coincheck, Everybody&rsquo;s Bitcoin, and Lastroots. The rest were either rejected by the FSA or voluntarily withdrew their applications.</p>
<p>The FSA resumed registering crypto exchanges this year, starting with Coincheck, which successfully registered on Jan. 11 with the help of its parent company, Monex Group. On March 25, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-approves-new-crypto-exchanges-140-more-interested/">Rakuten Wallet</a> (formerly Everybody&rsquo;s Bitcoin) and Decurret were registered, followed by Line Corp.&rsquo;s LVC on Sept. 6. LVC launched a crypto exchange called Bitmax on Sept. 17, which is a separate exchange from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japans-line-exchange-cryptocurrencies/">Bitbox</a>, another crypto exchange by Line. Bitbox began operations in July 2018 in all countries except Japan and the U.S. On Nov. 27, Lastroots became the latest to be approved by the FSA.</p>

According to a leaked screenshot of Bituniverse&rsquo;s &ldquo;Exchange Transparent Balance Rank,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s roughly 1.9 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> held on centralized trading platforms.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">There&rsquo;s $13.9 Billion Worth of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Allegedly Stored on Global Exchanges</h2>
<p>Last year, on January 3, the community supported the idea of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-proof-of-keys-day-begins-with-industry-wide-support/">&ldquo;Proof of Keys&rdquo; day</a> after crypto investor Trace Meyer started the withdrawal initiative. However, as January 3, 2020 approaches, it seems that lots of digital currency holders still don&rsquo;t appreciate the importance of possessing their own keys. This week a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4hq82/coinbase_owns_96623k_bitcoin_and_bitmex_owns/">leaked photo</a> of the <a href="https://www.bituniverse.org/">Bituniverse</a> application indicates there&rsquo;s allegedly 1.9 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($13.9 billion) currently stored on the world&rsquo;s most popular exchanges. The balance rank feature is not yet available on the Bituniverse app, but the company says that the full list will be available on December 12. The top two exchanges listed on the Bituniverse &ldquo;Exchange Transparent Balance Rank (ETBR)&rdquo; shows that Coinbase allegedly has 966.23K <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($7.1 billion) in storage while Bitmex holds roughly 265.14K <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($1.9 billion). Other notable exchanges listed on the ETBR include trading platforms Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Poloniex.</p>
<p>According to Bituniverse&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/bituniverse_org/status/1201695170959298563">recent tweet</a>, exchanges like Binance, Huobi Global, and Okex will also be included in the December 12 list. The exchanges don&rsquo;t provide the official data for the ETBR list, as the exchange balances are tracked independently by <a href="https://blog.peckshield.com/research.html">Peckshield</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io">Etherscan</a>. Bituniverse says they couldn&rsquo;t have made &ldquo;[the ETBR] without the help of Peckshield.&rdquo; After the photo of the Bituniverse ETBR leaked, Trace Meyer tweeted about the situation <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceMayer/status/1201365958780055552">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>1.925m+ Bitcoin supposedly being held at Coinbase, Bitmex, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bittrex, Coincheck and Poloniex just waiting to be lost like so many others &mdash; Have you tried to withdraw any lately?</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Digital currency enthusiasts discussed the exchange balance topic on Reddit as well. When one Redditor created a post that was titled: &ldquo;Coinbase owns 966.23k Bitcoin, and Bitmex owns 265.14k Bitcoin,&rdquo; a person <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4hq82/coinbase_owns_96623k_bitcoin_and_bitmex_owns/f9b63gz/">commented</a> about how the statement was phrased. &ldquo;You should put quotation marks around the &ldquo;owns&rdquo; &mdash; While they have the private keys to these coins, they act more like banks than bitcoiners. Most of these coins are their customers&rsquo; deposits,&rdquo; the Redditor remarked. Other people disagreed and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e4hq82/coinbase_owns_96623k_bitcoin_and_bitmex_owns/f9f0ir6/">said</a>: &ldquo;&lsquo;Owns&rsquo; is the correct term. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. They can get hacked or steal the coins at any time &mdash; They own them.&rdquo; The Bituniverse exchange balance list value is measured in tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), but it also contains exchange balances in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins&rsquo;</h2>
<p>The ETBR information is not the first time exchanges have been scrutinized for balance holdings. Seven months ago, veiwbase.com published a <a href="https://www.viewbase.com/blog/true-ranking-of-crypto-exchanges-according-to-blockchain-data">market analysis report</a> which ranked crypto exchanges by using balances derived from blockchain data. Similar to the ETBR-based list of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings, Viewbase researched the wallets belonging to exchanges using the Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) blockchain and analyzed their historical balances of ether. They chose <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> because it&rsquo;s the second-largest crypto market by capitalization and usually captures a lot of trade volume as well. &ldquo;We ranked exchanges by the amount of ether deposited in their exchange wallets and compared it to their reported trading volumes,&rdquo; the researchers&rsquo; report stressed. In that report, Kraken and Binance were noted as the largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> holders with balances over 5.4 million ether ($796 million) combined.</p>

<p>Even though veteran cryptocurrency proponents have been spreading this message for 10 years now, people still store vast amounts of crypto with third-party services that could go under at any moment. Moreover, there&rsquo;s been seven major cryptocurrency exchange hacks in 2019 where investors lost millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of crypto.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wisdomtree Launches Physically Backed Bitcoin ETP on Switzerland&rsquo;s Principal Stock Exchange</h2>
<p>On December 3, the American firm <a href="https://www.wisdomtree.com">Wisdomtree Investments</a> (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/wetf">NASDAQ: WETF</a>) announced the launch of a new BTC-based exchange-traded product (ETP) that will be traded on Switzerland&rsquo;s SIX stock exchange. The new product will be different from the other cryptocurrency ETPs traded on SIX, because the <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/security_info_de.html?id=GB00BJYDH287USD4">BTCW</a> product will be physically backed by bitcoins held in storage. The ticker BTCW will compete with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/7-crypto-etps-now-trading-on-main-swiss-stock-exchange/">seven other cryptocurrency ETPs</a> traded on SIX that essentially track a basket of digital assets or track the prices of single cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The Switzerland-based firm Amun AG is behind most of the crypto ETPs on SIX, which include cash-settled ETPs for a basket of coins, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>. The ETF provider Wisdomtree is the seventh largest ETF firm in the U.S. and has been offering exchange-traded products for nearly two decades. Wisdomtree&rsquo;s latest announcement says investors will get exposure to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The company also highlighted that with BTCW, investors will get &ldquo;access to institutional-grade storage solutions without needing to set it up with a custodian themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been monitoring cryptocurrencies for some time and are excited to bring investors secure access to this developing asset class,&rdquo; Wisdomtree&rsquo;s Head of European-based Products, Alexis Marinof, <a href="https://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-ch/-/media/eu-media-files/uncategorized/wisdomtree-bitcoin-launch-final.pdf">said</a>. &ldquo;Wisdomtree has a history of bringing innovative investment themes to a broad market through institutional-class products, allowing investors to take exposures in difficult-to-access asset classes &mdash; we see many parallels between the cryptocurrency space and commodities in this regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marinof added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>The introduction of cryptocurrencies in an ETP structure will enable investors to find new ways to introduce digital assets into portfolios while still relying on the safety and security that they have come to expect from Wisdomtree.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;Bringing Cryptocurrencies to the ETP Structure&rsquo;</h2>
<p>This is not Wisdomtree&rsquo;s first experience dealing with physically-backed ETPs as the company launched the world&rsquo;s first <a href="https://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-gb/-/media/eu-media-files/other-documents/operational/counterparty-risk-factsheets/counterparty-factsheet---physically-backed-etcs.pdf">physically backed gold</a> ETP in 2003. Moreover, the company has the largest ETF in terms of AUM in Europe as well because it utilizes European equities, but removes the volatility tethered to the exchange rates between the USD and EUR. The BTCW settlement will be handled by the International Central Securities Depository (ICSD) and Wisdomtree aims to &ldquo;offer liquidity like any other exchange-listed security.&rdquo; Wisdomtree notes that bringing digital currencies to the ETP structure may bring the possibility of liquidity centralization, which in turn could &ldquo;benefit the underlying digital asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cryptocurrencies are potentially the next asset class to benefit from increased interest when they become accessible in an ETP structure,&rdquo; Wisdomtree&rsquo;s capital markets and technology product development executive Rafi Aviav explained during the announcement. &ldquo;We have developed a solution which addresses the difficulties investors face in accessing digital assets and are bridging the gap between the underlying decentralised online blockchain technology and traditional investment structures.&rdquo;</p>
<figure id="attachment_350588" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350588" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350588 size-full" title="Wisdomtree's Physically Backed Bitcoin ETP Goes Live on SIX Stock Exchange" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-scaled.jpg" alt="Wisdomtree's Physically Backed Bitcoin ETP Goes Live on SIX Stock Exchange" width="2560" height="960" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-300x113.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-768x288.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-1536x576.jpg 1536w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-2048x768.jpg 2048w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-696x261.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-1392x522.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-1068x401.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-1120x420.jpg 1120w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hopscotch-1920x720.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350588" class="wp-caption-text">Wisdomtree&rsquo;s educational resources for investors.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aviav believes that the ETP system could invoke &ldquo;new dimensions&rdquo; into crypto markets, which include bolstering institutional-grade custody solutions. The Wisdomtree executive thinks that incorporating digital currency trading into standard brokerage accounts will make markets &ldquo;more liquid and transparent.&rdquo; At press time, Wisdomtree&rsquo;s BTCW product is <a href="https://www.six-group.com/exchanges/exchange_traded_products/security_info_de.html?id=GB00BJYDH287USD4">live</a> on Switzerland&rsquo;s principal stock exchange, but the investment vehicle is only available to institutional investors. Wisdomtree has also recently published <a href="https://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-gb/strategies/crypto-currency">various educational resources</a> for institutional and retail investors on how to invest in digital currencies and the &ldquo;rise of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Darknet Will Not Be Downed</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The drug market has become increasingly digitally enabled. Drugs purchased online can be transported across Europe and delivered to consumers by post and parcel services.&rdquo; So reads the forward to the latest </span><a href="http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/2019/drug-markets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU Drug Markets Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by Europol last week. The 260-page report makes for heavy bedtime reading, but darknet vendors eager to optimize their opsec will find useful clues in there on how to frustrate law enforcement. As the report acknowledges:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are notable challenges in identifying postal items containing drugs. For example, the total volume handled every day by a major postal centre such as the Mail Centre Vienna amounts to 4 million items. Furthermore, there is currently no mechanism in place for the reporting of suspicious parcels akin, for example, to the existing one for reporting suspicious financial transactions. Although systems are in place for service providers to remove and destroy suspicious parcels, they do not have a legal obligation to inform police authorities.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an indication of the quantity of drugs moving through the mail each day, the report notes that &ldquo;Since August 2016, about 8,500 postal items containing illicit drugs have been identified at international airports across Germany, amounting to a total of 404 kg of illicit drugs (287 kg amphetamine and 111 kg MDMA, as well as cocaine and cannabis) and 307 250 MDMA/ecstasy tablets.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Europol was applying the finishing touches to its painstakingly researched report, the darknet was undergoing one of its most turbulent months to date. The following rundown records November&rsquo;s key DNM talking points.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double-Crossing and DDoSing on the Darknet</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 4</strong>: Silk Road admin and drug dealer turned informant Curtis Green receives his first restitution check from jailed fed turned criminal Carl Mark Force.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, look what i just got in the mail. Carl mark Forces first if many restitution checks to me. he owes me thousands and I get a check for 25 dollars?  He does only make 12 cents an hour..

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 14</strong>: Cryptonia, one of the most popular DNMs </span><a href="https://darknetlive.com/post/what-happened-to-cryptonia-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goes down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time of writing, three weeks on, it is still offline, despite an admin </span><a href="https://dark.fail/archives/cryptonia/2019-downtime.txt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it will return and that users will receive the funds they are due. It&rsquo;s believed to be gone for good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 15</strong>: Dread, the darknet&rsquo;s main forum for all things DNM-related, goes offline and stays down for the next 10 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 22</strong>: The Independent </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/black-friday-2019-deals-dark-web-drugs-criminals-a9212356.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574414962"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discovers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that DNM vendors are offering Black Friday deals, seemingly unaware that this has been a thing since the Silk Road days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 22</strong>: Data scientist Andrea Baronchelli </span><a href="https://t.co/lHQWECJ4Ag"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Collective Dynamics of Dark Web Marketplaces.&rdquo; The report analyzes &ldquo;24 episodes of unexpected market closure through a novel datasets of 133 million Bitcoin transactions involving 31 dark markets and their users, totalling 4 billion USD.&rdquo; It found that &ldquo;coordinated user migration from the closed market to coexisting markets guarantees overall systemic resilience beyond the intrinsic fragility of individual markets. The migration is swift, efficient and common to all market closures.&rdquo; The hydra theory is true it would seem: lop off one darknet market and two will spring up to replace it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 23</strong>: Nightmare market is hacked, and its homepage defaced to display the dox of a Belarusian said to be a former admin of the site. The site exit scammed four months earlier, with the hack the final act of the crippled DNM&rsquo;s long goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 25</strong>: An admin for Grey Market, one of the smaller DNMs, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DarkDotFail/status/1199218711950962688"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that their computers were seized by LE and that anyone who used the market in the past week is compromised. Whatever the case may be, Grey Market is still online at press time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 25</strong>: Dread returns to the darknet, with admin Hugbunter </span><a href="https://dark.fail/archives/dread/hugbunter-2019-11-25.txt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explaining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a PGP signed message the technical reasons for its lengthy downtime. He also notes that someone claiming to be the FBI asked them to &ldquo;place a ban on opiate related posts on the site, following a case of a 15 year old who overdosed on fake oxys laced with fent.&rdquo; A couple of days later, the feds sign their own PGP message claiming that it wasn&rsquo;t them that asked for fentanyl discussions to be purged. Curiouser and curiouser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nov 26</strong>: Darknet monitoring site Dark.fail </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DarkDotFail/status/1199349497068969984"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reveals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 8chan successor 8kun&rsquo;s Tor hidden service has remained online despite its clearnet site being DDoSed. Darknet markets haven&rsquo;t been so fortunate, with Point/Tochka in particular spending days at a time offline. At the time of publication, the popular DNM and its Github repository have been down for a week. The site has been frequently offline all year, with DDoS attacks to blame. When Dread returned to life two days earlier, citing DDoS attacks, its admin wrote &ldquo;If any of the attacks were to be LE, I&rsquo;d put a bet on this one.&rdquo; Could feds be behind Point&rsquo;s hiatus as well?</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 Down, 30 to Go</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, three darknet markets disappeared in November: Berlusconi, Samsara, and Cryptonia. Despite this coup for law enforcement, these DNMs were merely the tip of the iceberg: with another 30-odd sites listed on </span><a href="https://dark.fail/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dark.fail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there&rsquo;s still plenty of places for cryptocurrency users to acquire their wares. At present, Empire Market appears to be soaking up most of the business, just as it has been all year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet markets are interlinked with bitcoin because <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remains the most popular means of paying for goods and services on them. There&rsquo;s another reason, though, why the two have synergies: the distributed design of DNMs gives them a utility akin to that of Bitcoin nodes. If one market disappears, or is found to be acting dishonestly, users will bypass it and route their business through the honest majority. In this manner, DNMs have proven incredibly resilient. Individually, each one is centralized, but collectively they form a decentralized market whose uptime since 2011 has rivaled Bitcoin itself.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Save the Children Adds More Crypto Capability</h2>
<p>Save the Children, which helps protect children from the effects of war and violence, has announced today the relaunch of its cryptocurrency fundraising capability effective 3 December, 2019. The global humanitarian organization is now able to accept multiple digital assets in automated fashion through its website including bitcoin core (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), zcash (ZEC), litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>) and the gemini dollar (GUSD).</p>
<p>The organization initially accepted bitcoin donations in 2013, in response to Typhoon Haiyan that struck Southeast Asia and devastated the Philippines. By accepting multiple cryptocurrencies, Save the Children is now offering more supporters with diverse cryptocurrency portfolios the ability to support the charity in a tax efficient way. The organization explains that the IRS classifies cryptocurrency donations as property, meaning they are not subject to capital gains tax and are tax deductible on the donor&rsquo;s tax returns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond cryptocurrency contributions, what if blockchain technology could be used to make supply chains more efficient, transactions more transparent and end world poverty through decentralized universal basic income as a form of unconditional cash vouchers? That would be a dream worth HODLing on to,&rdquo; stated Ettore Rossetti, Senior Director of Social & Digital Innovation of Save the Children. He added, &ldquo;Since our founding 100 years ago, Save the Children has reached more than 1 billion children. Perhaps the next Bitcoin billionaire can help us reach the next billion children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Save the Children is working with The Giving Block, which helps equip nonprofits with the tools and techniques to effectively raise funds with cryptocurrency. The organization&rsquo;s crypto donations relaunch is part of the Bitcoin Tuesday initiative, which offers a cryptocurrency twist on Giving Tuesday, a day held on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving that encourages philanthropy.</p>
<p>Discussing this year&rsquo;s campaign, Alex Wilson, Co-Founder of The Giving Block said, &ldquo;Giving Tuesday inspires millions around the world to support and give to the causes that matter to them. But, despite the enhanced tax benefits that crypto donations can offer donors, the day has failed to capture the attention of crypto donors in years past.&rdquo; His colleague, Co-Founder Pat Duffy added that, &ldquo;Bitcoin Tuesday will introduce a largely traditional audience to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, driving crypto adoption. When nonprofits accept crypto donations, the world sees crypto as the force for good we know it to be.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Cash Donation Options Are Expanding</h2>
<p>Among the many organizations participating in Bitcoin Tuesday, as listed on the initiative&rsquo;s <a href="https://bitcointuesday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, you can see a number that should be familiar to the Bitcoin Cash community. These include the Tor Project, which advances human rights and freedoms by deploying free and open anonymity and privacy technologies, as well as the Liberland Aid Foundation, which is the humanitarian arm of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liberlands-merit-token-built-on-bitcoin-cash-captures-a-1m-market-cap/">Free Republic of Liberland</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to donate using bitcoin cash you should also check out the options available on <a href="https://freedom.bitcoin.com/">Freedom.Bitcoin.com</a>. Here you can stand up for liberty, freedom, and inalienable human rights by supporting causes that include Free Ross Ulbricht, Defense Distributed Defense Fund, and Eatbch. The last is easily recognized as the Bitcoin Cash community&rsquo;s favorite charity because the nonprofit organization has been using <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> to help feed people throughout Venezuela and South Sudan.</p>
<p>Free Ross Ulbricht is focused on the case of the young man with no criminal history who was sentenced to over 40 years in prison without parole for creating the Silk Road website, an online marketplace using cryptocurrency and the Tor browser enabling anonymous exchange of a variety of goods. The Defense Distributed Defense Fund helps support the costly legal battle of the creator of world&rsquo;s first gun made with a 3D Printer.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years the ability to donate with bitcoin cash has expanded to even more fields. For example, in August the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/alcor-life-extension-foundation-now-accepts-bitcoin-cash-donations/">Alcor Life Extension Foundation</a> began accepting <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> donations for its cryonics research and operations in Scottsdale, Arizona. Alcor was convinced by Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s executive chairman Roger Ver to add <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> acceptance, the same person who convinced Alcor to accept <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> payments back in 2014.</p>
<p>A popular website that focuses on U.S. court documents and the litigation system, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/free-law-projects-courtlistener-repository-now-accepts-bitcoin-cash-donations/">Free Law Project&rsquo;s Courtlistener.com</a>, started accepting <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> for donations in June. Courtlistener captures hundreds of thousands of visitors every month by making high quality legal data widely available.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wikipedia-now-accepts-bitcoin-cash-donations-via-bitpay/">Wikipedia</a> and similar free knowledge projects, partnered with Bitpay in January to accept <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> donations. Bitpay works with many large non-profits to allow them to accept cryptocurrency donations, and reported that donations have increased dramatically in the last couple of years, especially at the end of the year as people look for tax benefits. The service reportedly processed several multi-million dollar donations to non-profits in 2018.</p>
<p>In September 2018 the French office of the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/unicef-france-accepts-donations-in-9-cryptocurrencies/">UNICEF</a>) started accepting donations in 9 of the most popular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash. Even some religious groups accept <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, like an evangelical church from the largest city in Switzerland, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/church-zurich-accepts-donations-bitcoin-bch-ether-ripple-stellar/">ICF Zurich</a>, which began accepting voluntary offerings from its parishioners using cryptocurrency in January 2018.</p>
