<h2 style="text-align: center;">Largest Lenders Write Off More Debt Than a Year Ago</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s largest lenders have been writing off more loans than they were last year, another indication that many businesses are hurting in a deteriorating economic environment. In Q3 of 2019, writedowns on bad debt at four major British banks increased 51% from the same quarter of 2018, the Daily Mail reported quoting corporate figures.</p>
<p>The amount of nonperforming loans that have been written off by RBS, Lloyds, HSBC, and Barclays between July and September reached &pound;1.76 billion (approx. $2.27 billion). During the same period last year it was around &pound;1.17 billion ($1.51 billion), an analysis conducted by U.K.-based financial services company AJ Bell shows.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344381 size-full" title="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849.jpg" alt="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" width="1000" height="506" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-300x152.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-768x389.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-696x352.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-830x420.jpg 830w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The difference of almost &pound;600 billion has been attributed to the worsening economic conditions that are negatively affecting more and more companies operating in the country. One such example is the British global travel group Thomas Cook which collapsed in September.</p>
<p>A total of 4,355 businesses were unable to pay their debts in the third quarter, according to official data from the U.K. government&rsquo;s Insolvency Service. That&rsquo;s the highest number in five years recorded by the London-headquartered executive agency of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Low Interest Rates to Further Squeeze Bank Revenues</h2>
<p>Bad loans are not the only challenge the United Kingdom&rsquo;s top lenders are currently facing. According to the publication, the banks have also warned they expect their revenues to be negatively affected by the low mortgage rates which are nearing their record lows at the moment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344383" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344383 size-full" title="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista.jpg" alt="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" width="730" height="490" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista.jpg 730w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-300x201.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-696x467.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-626x420.jpg 626w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-190x128.jpg 190w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-380x256.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344383" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/386301/uk-average-mortgage-interest-rates/">study</a> published by market data provider Statista, interest rates on mortgages in Britain have been continuously declining for the past five years. In June 2019, two-year fixed rate mortgages were at 1.65%, down from 2.60% in the summer of 2014. The two-year variable interest rate has dropped from 2.71% to 1.99. The 10-year fixed rate has decreased from 4.06% in September 2014 to 2.63% this past June.</p>
<p>Credit institutions can hardly raise rates on mortgages right now as the base interest rate set by the Bank of England is only 0.75%. It has remained below 1% ever since the central bank&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee cut it in 2009 to 0.5% where it stayed for around seven years. The average variable mortgage rate at the time was 2.5%. The rate was dropped to its lowest ever mark of 0.25% in August 2016.</p>

<p>Although the cost of borrowing was raised in August 2018 to 0.75%, its highest level since early 2009, serious concerns remain regarding the state of the British economy and its perspectives. After another unsuccessful attempt to leave the European Union, the U.K. is now heading towards its third general election in five years, which is creating more uncertainty for its economy already weakened by the global economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, things have been developing differently in the nascent crypto banking sector where loans backed with digital assets and cryptocurrency deposits are enjoying <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/earn-more-interest-on-your-crypto-with-these-comparison-tools/">growing popularity</a>. Platforms such as <a href="https://mycred.io/">Cred</a> offer clients an opportunity to <a href="https://earn.mycred.io/bitcoin">earn</a> up to 10% interest on their holdings in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and <a href="https://mycred.io/borrow/">borrow</a> using their crypto as collateral. Cred also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cred-merchant-solutions-to-help-unbanked-business-sectors/">provides solutions</a> to unbanked business sectors.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Re-Gadgetification of Things</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">80s kids mourning the loss of the gadget-based society they were raised in are naturally drawn to crypto cold storage. For every device (portable radio; spirit level; tape measure) that was subsumed into the iPhone, there&rsquo;s another that hardware wallet (HW) manufacturers have seen fit to develop and isolate from the smartphone in the name of opsec.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a logic in wanting to keep your hot assets &ndash; i.e anything connected to the web &ndash; separate from your cold &ndash; typically those you cherish the most and have no intention of liquidating in a hurry. That said, it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to tell how much of these aftermarket HW accessories are actually helping, and how much of it is just cold storage theater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That there are benefits to keeping your <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/">crypto assets</a> safely stashed where hackers, phishers, and SIM-swappers can&rsquo;t operate is clear. What&rsquo;s less evident is whether entombing your hardware wallet in a hermetically sealed vault kept at absolute zero with a pack of rottweilers guarding it and anti-tank guns watching the skies is absolutely necessary. Until we see empirical studies on the success rates of extreme opsec compared with, say, scrawling your seed phrase on a scrap of paper and stashing it in a drawer, it&rsquo;s really hard to say.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_344321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344321" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344321 size-large" title="Cryptosteel Capsule Will Keep Your Wallet Seed Safe and Out of Sight" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel-1024x819.jpg" alt="Cryptosteel Capsule Will Keep Your Wallet Seed Safe and Out of Sight" width="696" height="557" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel-300x240.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel-768x614.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel-696x557.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel-525x420.jpg 525w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crypto-steel.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344321" class="wp-caption-text">The Cryptosteel Capsule comes with 800 character tiles</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mother of All Backups</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivered in a smart tray that evokes a luxury chocolate box, the Cryptosteel is described as &ldquo;the mother of all backups.&rdquo; Not the daddy, not the son, and certainly not the creepy half-cousin: the &lsquo;steel is all momma. The device, </span><a href="https://cryptosteel.com/product/cryptosteel-capsule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available singly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or in packs of up to five, is described as being &ldquo;compatible with most secret sharing and key generation algorithms.&rdquo; By that, its manufacturers mean there&rsquo;s enough numbers and letters in the box to cover most 12-word seed permutations. You can cram 123 characters onto the stick before it&rsquo;s maxed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the stick isn&rsquo;t quite accommodating enough for a 24-word seed: in testing, I managed 21 words before running out of space. Given that the capsules retail for $100, it seems a little excessive to require multiple capsules to store a single seed. That said, 12 words should suffice for most wallet seeds, and you might even fit on 24 words if they happen to be short and you remove the word separators that are meant to be inserted.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Than a Steel Punch in the Face</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like the <a href="https://cryptosteel.com/product/cryptosteel-capsule/">Cryptosteel Capsule</a>, despite its limitations. It&rsquo;s not as alpha as using a steel punch, but it&rsquo;s a lot easier to create your wallet seed with, and feels almost as permanent. Just be careful when the time comes to unthread it, as one slip and your painstakingly assembled seed will be alphabet soup. It&rsquo;s hard to say whether sitting in bed threading steel beads onto a metal stick is the financial sovereignty Satoshi dreamed of, or simply a regression to making macaroni art in kindergarten, but it sure is fun. More importantly, it&rsquo;s a secure way of recording your seed provided you can keep the innocuous looking capsule in a safe place away from prying eyes.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Director&rsquo;s Refusal Axed, Fund Green-Lighted</h2>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published a document Wednesday detailing Commissioner Lawrence P. Haber&rsquo;s reasons to overturn the commission&rsquo;s previous decision regarding 3IQ Corp and The Bitcoin Fund. A preliminary prospectus for the public offering of this fund was filed with the OSC&rsquo;s Investment Funds & Structured Products branch (IFSP) in October last year. However, in February, the IFSP refused to issue a receipt of The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s prospectus after its staff raised a number of concerns.</p>
<p>3IQ Corp and The Bitcoin Fund subsequently applied for a hearing and a review of this decision. After multiple hearings, Commissioner Haber ruled on Tuesday that the staff&rsquo;s concerns &ldquo;do not warrant denying a receipt for The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s prospectus&rdquo; and ordered the IFSP director&rsquo;s decision to be set aside and a receipt for a final prospectus of The Bitcoin Fund issued. Unless the staff can find new grounds for refusal, the final prospectus can be used to offer securities to the public.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344101 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="482" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-300x145.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-768x370.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-696x335.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-871x420.jpg 871w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Canadian investment fund manager 3IQ Corp. confirmed Wednesday that &ldquo;it has received a favorable ruling&rdquo; from its public hearing before an OSC panel regarding The Bitcoin Fund. The fund will be a public, non-redeemable investment fund that will invest all of its assets in bitcoin. 3IQ, which also manages a private crypto investment fund, will be The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s investment and portfolio manager.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not Our Job to Decide the Merits of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In the document, Commissioner Haber addressed every concern raised by the IFSP staff. He began by stating that this case &ldquo;is not about the merits of bitcoin as an investment&rdquo; because &ldquo;It is not the role of securities regulators to approve or disapprove of the merits of securities being offered to the public.&rdquo; He pointed out that all prospectuses filed in Canada even say on the cover page that &ldquo;No securities regulatory authority has expressed an opinion about these securities and it is an offence to claim otherwise.&rdquo; The commissioner remarked:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is also outside the scope of the authority of securities regulators to immunize investors against risk or against loss. And, it is not the job of securities regulators to ban speculation or risk-taking.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344104 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The document further explains that while bitcoin is &ldquo;a novel asset in an emerging and evolving market,&rdquo; it can later mature and change significantly, adding that although some assets in this class fail and become tulip bulbs, others can become gold and the next generation of technology. &ldquo;Securities regulators are not mandated to try to pick winners and losers,&rdquo; the document details.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Is Not Illiquid</h2>
<p>As a key reason for rejection, the IFSP staff submits that &ldquo;Bitcoin is an illiquid asset &hellip; Therefore, by holding bitcoin, the fund would not comply with the restriction against holding illiquid assets set out in section 2.4 of NI 81-102.&rdquo; Commissioner Haber disagreed. He said: &ldquo;I do not agree with Staff&rsquo;s submission &hellip; I find that Staff has not shown that bitcoin is an illiquid asset, as defined in NI 81-102,&rdquo; emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I find that there is sufficient evidence of real volume and real trading in bitcoin on registered exchanges in large dollar size, both in absolute terms and compared to other markets for commodities and equities, which constitutes a liquid market.</p></blockquote>
<p>The commissioner referenced some existing investment products providing exposure to bitcoin such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which is available to Canadians.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Price Manipulation</h2>
<p>The IFSP staff also decided that it is not in the public interest to issue a receipt for the fund&rsquo;s prospectus due to concerns about its &ldquo;ability to value its assets for investors given the significant market integrity concerns regarding the trading of bitcoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;the security and safekeeping of the fund&rsquo;s bitcoin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fund&rsquo;s ability to file audited financial statements, as required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding price manipulation associated with crypto assets, Haber concluded that the staff &ldquo;has not established that the fund will be unable to arrive at a net asset value that satisfies the requirements of NI 81-106.&rdquo; While acknowledging the existence of fake volumes and unregistered market trading, the commissioner said the &ldquo;Staff has not proven that true price discovery in the bitcoin market is prevented by insufficient &lsquo;true trading&rsquo; or price manipulation, at least on the regulated exchanges.&rdquo; He added that the evidence presented to him suggests that wash trading and fake volume are used primarily to attract more traders and issuers, and &ldquo;did not establish systemic and sustained manipulation of the price of bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344105 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The commissioner also placed weights on the steps taken by the company to mitigate the risks of manipulation such as its selection of MVIBTC as the index and the fund&rsquo;s non-redeemable structure. He also noted that other bitcoin holdings, such as GBTC, have been successfully valued, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is worth noting that bitcoin is a commodity, not an equity or other security &hellip; The risk of market manipulation exists in all commodity markets. Many of Staff&rsquo;s stated concerns could apply equally to other commodities, such as precious metals or foreign currencies. Staff did not persuade me that bitcoin is more susceptible to manipulation than other commodity products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding custodian and security risk, the commissioner said, &ldquo;Like any valuable commodity, I accept that bitcoin can be stolen or lost.&rdquo; He conveyed that the staff did not establish that the fund&rsquo;s custodians do not follow sufficient practices for safeguarding bitcoin. Commenting on New York-based Gemini Trust Company which will act as a custodian of the fund&rsquo;s bitcoin, Haber opined, &ldquo;I am not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence that professional, regulated crypto-asset custodians, like Gemini, have suffered losses of customer assets.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Staff&rsquo;s Lack of Authority</h2>
<p>Commissioner Haber also disagreed with the staff&rsquo;s submission that investor protection extends to the assets the fund proposes to hold or the markets in which they trade. He explained that if the staff&rsquo;s analysis were to apply to The Bitcoin Fund, then &ldquo;it would amount to a ban on any funds holding bitcoin, regardless of their structure or management.&rdquo; Furthermore, he pointed out that &ldquo;the length of Staff&rsquo;s proposed ban would be uncertain,&rdquo; emphasizing that the ban would effectively remain in place until the staff&rsquo;s concerns have diminished, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Staff has not provided any authority for imposing such an indeterminate ban.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344109 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Investor Protection</h2>
<p>Since investors have other means of acquiring bitcoin, the commissioner questioned how the staff&rsquo;s proposed ban would protect them from &ldquo;unfair, improper or fraudulent practices.&rdquo; On the contrary, he expects it will ensure that investors could not invest in bitcoin through a public fund, reiterating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Denying investors the opportunity to invest in bitcoin through a public fund would not promote fair and efficient capital markets and confidence in capital markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, it would suggest that investors should acquire bitcoin through unregulated vehicles, and capital market participants should be encouraged to create those vehicles,&rdquo; the commissioner opined. He believes that &ldquo;The issuance of a receipt for the final prospectus of the fund would promote efficient capital markets by creating an alternative to GBTC,&rdquo; which he noted is available to Canadian retail investors but trades at a significant premium to its net asset value. It would also &ldquo;promote efficient capital markets by giving retail investors a means of diversifying their investment portfolios through access to an additional uncorrelated asset class,&rdquo; the commissioner concluded.</p>

Wright looked as though it was coming to an end as the two parties reached a non-binding settlement. Then on October 30, without much notice, Wright explained that he couldn&rsquo;t finance the settlement and the agreement was broken. Now the trial will start again and the Kleiman estate hopes to depose Wright&rsquo;s former chief financial officer, James Wilson on November 8.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wright Breaks the Non-Binding Settlement as the Billion Dollar Bitcoin Lawsuit Continues</h2>
<p>Australian native Craig Wright, the man who claims to be Bitcoin&rsquo;s inventor, will be seeing more court proceedings in the near future as the notorious Kleiman v. Wright case is back on. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/kleiman-v-wright/">Craig Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman</a>, the brother of the now-deceased David Kleiman, for allegedly interfering with David&rsquo;s bitcoin assets and intellectual property after he died. Last September, news.Bitcoin.com reported on how the two parties were seemingly headed toward a settlement as both legal teams came to a non-binding settlement. This happened after the judge ruled the Kleimans were to be awarded 50% of Wright&rsquo;s alleged <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings and 50% of his blockchain intellectual property (IP). However, the Kleiman estate has filed a new <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.290.0.pdf">court document</a> which details that &ldquo;Craig could no longer finance the settlement and was &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; the non-binding settlement agreement.&rdquo; So Roche Freedman LLP wrote in the filing that after a lot of &ldquo;lost time&rdquo; the team will be &ldquo;shifting back into preparing for trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-344269" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="400" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s.jpg 880w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s-300x136.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s-768x349.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s-696x316.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"></p>
<p>Following the broken settlement, the law firm explained it was in contact with James Wilson, the chief financial officer (CFO) of Craig&rsquo;s companies in 2012-2013. This period of time is when Dave Kleiman was still alive and Wright alleged that he sold Dave interest in his businesses in exchange for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Although Wright&rsquo;s legal team, Rivero Mestre LLP, came back five hours after the Kleiman estate requested permission to depose Wilson and informed the plaintiffs they would not consent to the deposition on November 8. Wright&rsquo;s council said the team would need to consent to a video deposition at a later date.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Due to the unexpected failure of settlement negotiations, and the soon approaching discovery cutoff, the parties are short on time,&rdquo; Roche Freedman&rsquo;s filing notes. &ldquo;Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s presence in the United States next week obviates the need for the parties to go through the legal, logistical, and expensive steps of securing a deposition in Australia. And while Craig won&rsquo;t have been afforded a full 14-days notice, he has received 7-days notice.&rdquo; The Kleiman estate&rsquo;s court filing adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Importantly the fact that Craig doesn&rsquo;t have 14-days notice of this deposition is a product of his own conduct. He asked the parties to pause the litigation process and concentrate on amicably resolving this dispute, only to pull his consent with no advance notice, without good cause, and at a time when it simply wasn&rsquo;t possible to give him the full 14-days notice.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">James Wilson and Cryptoloc Technology</h2>
<p>According to the Twitter handle &lsquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy007forsure/status/1190940848034201601">Seeking Satoshi</a>,&rsquo; James Wilson is a former business associate of Wright&rsquo;s and co-patent holder. &ldquo;So the court in Florida would like to have a chat with Jamie Wilson, one time CFO for one of Craig&rsquo;s dodgy companies and co-patent holder for Cryptoloc. But what does the court want from Jamie?&rdquo; Seeking Satoshi asked on Twitter. &ldquo;Do they think Jamie can shed some light on Craig&rsquo;s financial dealings with Dave? Or do they suspect that Dave was involved in the development of Jamie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cryptoloc&rsquo; and may be owed some money for his hand in the IP behind it?&rdquo; The researcher continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>I doubt the court will uncover much from speaking with Jamie and I don&rsquo;t think any IP, bitcoin or money will be found that belongs to Dave. At some point, the court will realise there is no Tulip trust and no bitcoin and that Craig has led everyone on a goose chase.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Wilson is also mentioned in a <a href="https://medium.com/@craig_10243/from-the-bygone-days-of-yore-part-1-632efa716024">blog post</a> called &ldquo;From the Bygone Days of Yore &mdash; Part 1,&rdquo; written by Wright in June. Wright stated at the time that he had video link meetings with &ldquo;Jamie Wilson, Robert Urquhart, and Dave Kleiman&rdquo; with lawyers present in 2012. Roche Freedman&rsquo;s motion requests that the court allows them to depose Wilson on November 8 with the defense team present via video-link. According to the court documents, a trial is scheduled to start on March 30, 2020, depending on the proceedings.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Maker&rsquo;s Multi-Collateral Dai Will Launch November 18</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance project <a href="https://makerdao.com/">Makerdao</a> is responsible for creating the cryptocurrency-backed stablecoin called dai. Initially, the project used <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> as a form of collateral in order to issue dai but the project revealed that in the future a variety of other digital assets could be used. <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/breaking-launch-date-of-multi-collateral-dai-announced-at-devcon-5/">Announced</a> at the Devcon 5 conference in Osaka, MCD will bring new features like the dai savings rate (DSR) and a collateralized debt position (CDP) will be known as a &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/say-goodbye-to-cdps-and-hello-to-maker-vaults/">vault</a>.&rdquo; Collateral types first evaluated include coins like augur (REP), digixdao (DGD), golem (GNT), omisego (OMG), ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), and 0x (ZRX). This means that there will be two types of coins produced by the community: single collateral dai (what dai is today) will be called &lsquo;sai,&rsquo; while MCD created coins will be called dai.</p>

<p>In March, news.Bitcoin.com took an in-depth look at the Ethereum-based Makerdao and dai stablecoin. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/an-in-depth-look-at-ethereums-maker-and-the-stablecoin-dai/">report</a> explained that a CDP now known as a vault required 150% of the loan amount in dai that&rsquo;s paid for with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>. Moreover, there&rsquo;s a stability fee (interest rate) that accrues during the life of dai loans. Since the project&rsquo;s launch, the coin has maintained a fairly stable existence despite a few hiccups along the way. In mid-April, the Makerdao community <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/maker-community-votes-to-raise-stability-fee-as-dai-struggles-to-hold-1-peg/">voted multiple times</a> to raise the stability fee because dai tokens were struggling to hold the $1 peg. The issues upset dai borrowers when the stability fee skyrocketed from 0.5% to 19.5%. The interest rate increases had also made dai&rsquo;s price jump above the $1 peg and many exchanges saw dai sold for more than $1.05 per coin.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Natural Centralization?</h2>
<p>On October 28, Daniel Onggunhao, a software engineer at Binance, revealed that the dai stability fee was reduced to 5.5%. &ldquo;A single whale (with 97% of voting power) made the decision &mdash; Went from 2,489 votes a few hours ago, to 44,539 votes,&rdquo; Onggunhao <a href="https://twitter.com/onggunhao/status/1188824097918029825?s=21">tweeted</a>. &ldquo;I say this normatively, as neither good nor bad. In a perfect world, it&rsquo;d be great if we had a distributed voter pool for a move this big.&rdquo; Onggunhao added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>The pragmatic reality is that as an early stage, hard-to-understand technology, decision making tends to naturally centralize.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>A number of cryptocurrency community members discussed the whale vote after Onggunhao&rsquo;s tweet. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1188834950117646336">quick to quip</a>: &ldquo;Welcome to &lsquo;decentralization,&rsquo; where anything is possible, and not under anyone&rsquo;s control, even some re-centralization.&rdquo; Not everyone thought the &lsquo;re-centralization&rsquo; concept was a good idea for Makerdao&rsquo;s claimed &lsquo;decentralized&rsquo; governance system. &ldquo;Stake-based systems [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)] centralise much faster than alternatives because there&rsquo;s no maintenance cost, and in the early stages, bulk stake acquisition is always going to be easier than buying hardware in any real quantity,&rdquo; Monero&rsquo;s Riccardo Spagni <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/1189073863122079744">replied</a> during the conversation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344093" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344093" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344093 size-full" title="Maker's Stability Fee Drops to 5.5% After Multi-Collateral Dai Announcement" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-terminology-copy-1-1024x147.jpg" alt="Maker's Stability Fee Drops to 5.5% After Multi-Collateral Dai Announcement" width="1024" height="147" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-terminology-copy-1-1024x147.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-terminology-copy-1-1024x147-300x43.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-terminology-copy-1-1024x147-768x110.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-terminology-copy-1-1024x147-696x100.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344093" class="wp-caption-text">CDPs have rebranded to vaults.</figcaption></figure>
<p>One person <a href="https://twitter.com/tarpmaster/status/1188827352517754881">disagreed</a> with Onggunhao&rsquo;s initial tweet and said that he didn&rsquo;t think there was a &ldquo;single &lsquo;whale&rsquo; with 97% voting power.&rdquo; &ldquo;There could be a voter that represents 97% of this particular vote &mdash; This is still an issue, but it&rsquo;s about governance not control.&rdquo; Onggunhao agreed and <a href="https://twitter.com/onggunhao/status/1188828073447182337">further stressed</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>That&rsquo;s true, I apologize for dashing off the tweet. I also made an error in the amount (94.7% instead of 97%).</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Collateralized Multi-Coin Options and a Fee Reduction Will Likely Add More Growth to the Makerdao System</h2>
<p>The Makerdao project has been a favorite among the cryptocurrency community because the stablecoin dais are backed by digital currency and a decentralized autonomous organization. The stablecoin is not without its <a href="https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484">critics</a>, and the Maker protocol is still a very young network. However, with added coins stemming from the MCD launch and Maker&rsquo;s stability fee reduction, it&rsquo;s likely the dai ecosystem will grow much larger. At present, roughly 2.2% of all the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> in existence is locked into the Maker system.</p>

A Twitter user in the space known for hair trigger accusations</strong><strong> calls Molt a scammer in the video, and Molt proceeds to knock off the guy&rsquo;s baseball cap. Amusing as the sophomoric dumpster fires of crypto Twitter may be, Molt&rsquo;s story is illustrative of all-too-common behavior in crypto worthy of focused caution. Before forking over fees for Molt&rsquo;s Satoshi School courses or bitcoin branded champagne, be sure to know the real story beneath the great head of hair. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The &lsquo;Co-Founder&rsquo; of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>While Molt&rsquo;s reported past of sordid scams, numerous aliases, and life as a DJ in Germany is the source of all kinds of speculation and <a href="http://nakamolto.info/nm/">internet sleuthing</a>, one thing that is immediately verifiable is that he continues to make larger-than-life claims. Molt <a href="https://satoshi-school.com/en/our-vision/">sells himself</a> (and by extension his courses and <a href="https://www.bitcoin-sekt.de">BTC-branded bubbly</a>) as &ldquo;Co-founder of BitCoin&rdquo; and &ldquo;one of the few experts in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.&rdquo; He also created something called the Satoshi School, with a website that states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Satoshi School is the only school in the world that teaches exclusively about BitCoin and BitCoin blockchain technology in a location that suits you. It was founded in 2016 by BitCoin co-founder J&ouml;rg Molt &ndash; who has been working on global digital cash projects since 1995.</p></blockquote>
<p>To see what Molt really means when he says &ldquo;co-founder,&rdquo; a Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_Xa5taAtgc">interview</a> with Steven Melnik sheds some light on the slippery language. &ldquo;It is the magic about that people from all over the world had the same idea at this time,&rdquo; Molt states of the pre-bitcoin era, affirming in the video that even people who were simply working toward the creation of digital money in general, are all &ldquo;co-founders.&rdquo; The interviewer aptly notes that just because some folks thought about ride sharing before Uber, they are not magically co-founders of the company.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Decried by the Boy Who Cried Wolf</h2>
<p>Many in the space aren&rsquo;t having Molt&rsquo;s conveniently vague language and loud claims of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-blockchain-cruise-bitcoin-20180119-story.html">owning 250,000 bitcoins</a>, of course. At the recent WCC Vegas Blockchain Week <a href="https://evolv.events">event</a>, Twitter user @KennethBosak, known in part for his 2018 <a href="https://twitter.com/KennethBosak/status/996500626308849666">video</a> where he accosts two unsuspecting booth workers with all the charm of a botched root canal, pointed to Molt, <a href="https://twitter.com/KennethBosak/status/1190065532021534720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">filming</a> and saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>This guy right here, He&rsquo;s not Satoshi. He&rsquo;s telling people he&rsquo;s [expletive] Satoshi &hellip; You don&rsquo;t belong in the space. Get out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bosak claims &ldquo;Nakamolto&rdquo; was telling conference attendees he was Satoshi, but this has not been verified. Molt&rsquo;s reaction to the challenge was to return verbal fire and then sneakily knock off Bosak&rsquo;s hat. The exchange is childish and of the caliber one would expect from internet sensation seeking. The incident and ensuing attention were apparently enough to send Molt running from Twitter, though, as his account has since been <a href="https://twitter.com/joergmolt">deactivated</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Satoshi LARP Parade Continues</h2>
<p>The last &ldquo;Satoshi&rdquo; gave his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-self-proclaimed-satoshi-fails-to-sway-crypto-community/">big reveal</a> back in August to quickly fizzled attention. Like Molt, like Craig Wright, and like so many other attention-seekers in the space, claims were made that Bitcoin had somehow lost its way and been corrupted by greed and lack of leadership. And of course, only the newly revealed Satoshi could fix this. Proof isn&rsquo;t provided, however, and critique of this lack of evidence is often met with scandalized shouting and gaslighting. After all, what&rsquo;s the fun of live-action role play if no one believes you?</p>
<p>The crypto space is difficult to navigate for dazzled newbies. Thanks to long strings of priming buzzwords like &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; and purposefully vague language, understanding fundamentals becomes a challenge. Much like the televangelist&rsquo;s insatiable need to talk about his private jet and gold-threaded suit &mdash; while making the congregation all too aware they might miss out on theirs &mdash; crypto cons similarly give themselves away. After all, nobody wants to miss out on bitcoin paradise, and a messiah complex goes a long way in selling the story. As for Molt, the veracity of his co-founder status claim, and how many will ultimately become disciples, remains to be seen.</p>

The new point-of-sale system will help unbanked business sectors, such as California&rsquo;s cannabis industry, accept crypto payments from customers and pay taxes.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cred Merchant Solutions Debut</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://universalprotocol.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Protocol Alliance</a> (UPA) and <a href="https://www.mycred.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cred</a> have held a private event at the Ohana Cannabis Dispensary in Emeryville, California, on Wednesday, October 30 to celebrate San Francisco Blockchain Week.</p>
<p>Dan Schatt, Cred CEO and co-founder, unveiled during the event the new Cred Merchant Solutions, a point-of-sale handheld terminal that supports the unbanked, underbanked and poorly banked around the world. The Android-based terminal will be deployed to businesses at cost and help them quickly pay taxes, dramatically lower transaction fees and reinvest money back into the business.</p>
<p>Cred Merchant Solutions converts a customer&rsquo;s payment in crypto that is then loaned out to businesses around the world, while merchants instantly get the cash sales equivalent and governments get their share of the taxes, Schatt explained to an audience of about 100 attendees at the event. The new system is said to be faster than Square, fairer than Visa and friendlier than Chase. With it, customers are able to pay the way they want, merchants can use it to earn, borrow and save, and local governments will receive real-time tax revenue.</p>

<p>Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Cred is a decentralized banking platform serving customers in 179 countries with over $300 million in lending capital. It offers interest rates on more than 30 crypto and fiat currencies through its partner network. Cred was founded by former Paypal veterans with the mission of allowing everyone to benefit from low-cost credit products.</p>
<p>The Universal Protocol Alliance is a group of like-minded cryptocurrency companies and blockchain organizations that want to connect different digital assets in a single network. The alliance members include Bittrex, Brave, Certik, Omisego, Blockchain at Berkeley, Uphold, and Cred. The group has issued the Universal Dollar (UPUSD), the first stablecoin to be listed on Uphold. Every UPUSD is backed by the U.S. dollar and coins are minted on-chain with every transaction written to Ethereum.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">California to Lead US in Crypto Payments</h2>
<p>Cred&rsquo;s Taking Crypto to a New High event drew in local elected representatives, such as Emeryville Mayor Ally Medina, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arregu&iacute;n, and Berkeley Council member Ben Bartlett. This is because Cred Merchant Solutions will help support business sectors underserved by banks, like the $2 billion+ a year California cannabis industry.</p>
<p>U.S. federal banking regulations currently deem cannabis sales as illegal activities, which causes dispensaries to lack access to traditional banking and leaves them exposed to extra security risks. Despite this, the industry has continued to grow steadily and local companies need dependable access to financial services. In fact, sales in California represented about 34% of legal sales in the United States last year.</p>

<p>Cannabis stores in California sold about $2.5 billion worth of products in 2018 alone. This is compared to just $1.5 billion in Colorado&rsquo;s cannabis market, $1 billion in Washington, and $0.6 billion in Oregon. The authorities have enjoyed the growth in the sector too as the first quarter of 2018 brought in $60.9 million of tax revenues, the second $80.2 million, the third $100.8, and the fourth $111.9 million. This tax revenue is only expected to increase as the cannabis market in California is projected to jump to $7.7 billion by 2022 due to the opening of the recreational market.</p>
<p>Berkeley&rsquo;s Bartlett also announced that he&rsquo;s sponsoring a city plan to let businesses deploy Cred Merchant Solutions for tax collections and that he will work to enact similar legislation statewide so that California serves as a harbinger for others on tackling the problem of cash-intensive businesses. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s missing is money. When 70% of these operators are unbanked, we&rsquo;re missing the money,&rdquo; Bartlett said. &ldquo;One way we can ease the burden amongst these companies is to alleviate their burden, achieve safety, and receive tax revenue for the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>California is home to innovative startups, technology companies and many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and beyond. As such it should not be surprising that it will lead the adoption of cryptocurrency payments in the U.S. In September we <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/california-city-official-uses-bitcoin-cash-to-purchase-cannabis/">reported</a> that Bartlett became the first elected official to purchase cannabis using a digital asset. He utilized bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) and Cred&rsquo;s LBA token to facilitate the transaction at the Ohana Cannabis dispensary in Emeryville.</p>

The small financial institution, which has around 30 branches only in the Yichuan county, experienced a bank run sparked by rumors that its top management was in trouble with the law and mounting speculations the bank was on the brink of insolvency. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bank Run Highlights Increasing Depositor Anxiety</h2>
<p>Hundreds of depositors gathered at Yichuan Bank&rsquo;s offices this week to retrieve their savings before the feared collapse and found they were unable to withdraw their money. Meanwhile, authorities confirmed on Wednesday they are investigating the former chairman of the bank and its biggest stakeholder, Kang Fengli, for suspected corruption, Reuters reported. Police also arrested a woman, a local resident, for allegedly spreading false information about the bank&rsquo;s financial state.</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid the bank run, the lender issued a notice assuring depositors of its financial health. The bank also urged them to ignore the rumors and tried to dissuade them from withdrawing their funds. Security at bank branches was heightened. Bank employees stacked wads of large denomination yuan bills before clients&rsquo; eyes and reporters&rsquo; cameras to calm the situation and prove Yichuan had enough cash to continue to operate normally.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344121 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223.jpg" alt="Another Chinese Lender Bailed Out After Bank Run" width="1000" height="497" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223-300x149.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223-768x382.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223-324x160.jpg 324w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223-696x346.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1147084223-845x420.jpg 845w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Despite the small size of Yichuan Rural Commercial Bank, the commotion around the events did not go unnoticed by financial authorities on the regional and national level. The increasing depositor anxiety, exacerbated by the noticeable economic slowdown in the country and the brewing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liquidity-difficulties-in-china-second-bank-bail-out-now-reality/">liquidity crisis</a> in China&rsquo;s banking sector, had to be addressed with a decisive intervention by the state to prevent the spread of dangerous uncertainty.</p>
<p>The online edition of the local Communist Party newspaper reported that the Yichuan bank has received 30 billion yuan (over $4.26 billion) in the form of urgent funding from the Henan Province Rural Credit Cooperatives Union. Another 5 billion yuan were provided by the local branch of the People&rsquo;s Bank of China and 1.5 billion yuan came from the Henan Rural Commercial Bank, Yichuan News detailed on Wednesday. It also revealed that the Party committee of Yichuan county held a special meeting to resolve the situation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;Small&rsquo; Crisis Elicits Strong Reaction From the State</h2>
<p>Yichuan Bank has only around 62 billion yuan in assets (approximately $8.9 billion), according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. At the same time, data from the China Chengxin International Rating Agency shows that the lender accounted for 71% of deposits and 82% of loans in its county, as of September 2018. Clearly a small bank with local significance, yet the vigorous actions of the Chinese authorities betray their strong concerns the case may lead to loss of confidence in bank deposits beyond the region.</p>
<p>Whether the government&rsquo;s aggressive measures will be sufficient to calm down farmers and savers in Henan province remains to be seen. What&rsquo;s worrying, though, is that this is not the first time a Chinese bank has needed a bailout recently. At least three other regional lenders had to be saved by Beijing earlier this year.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344122 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084.jpg" alt="Another Chinese Lender Bailed Out After Bank Run" width="1000" height="494" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084-300x148.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084-768x379.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084-324x160.jpg 324w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084-648x320.jpg 648w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084-696x344.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_313388084-850x420.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Baoshang Bank, based in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, collapsed in May and was seized by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. A couple of months later Bank of Jinzhou, which operates in the Liaoning province, was bailed out by three state-controlled asset managers. Then in August, Heng Feng Bank failed and was nationalized.</p>
<p>A list published by Zerohedge contains almost 20 small to medium-sized Chinese banks that have been late with their annual reports. The latest available data from Barclays Research shows they controlled almost 4.5 trillion yuan ($650 billion) in assets in 2017. Heng Feng, which is the largest financial institution in the list, had over 1.4 trillion yuan in assets, Bank of Jinzhou is second with 723 billion, and Baoshang Bank is fourth with 576 billion in assets.</p>
<p>The news of the bank run at Yichuan Rural Commercial Bank comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping put blockchain development in the focus of government efforts during a Politburo meeting. And while crypto markets reacted positively to his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-chinas-new-fascination-with-blockchain-really-good-for-bitcoin/">bullish speech</a>, the People&rsquo;s Republic doesn&rsquo;t seem to be planning to invest in developing <a href="https://earn.mycred.io/bitcoin">crypto banking</a>, for example, only a digital version of its fiat yuan.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">CME Group&rsquo;s Bitcoin Options</h2>
<p>The global markets company CME Group has provided clients with the ability to hedge or trade benchmark options on futures across nearly every asset class. The firm has an average daily volume of $4.3 million this year and aims to offer options on bitcoin futures so investors can have a variety of different methods to trade the asset. When CME announced the launch of bitcoin options, McCourt <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cme-bitcoin-futures-sees-institutional-interest-and-demand-from-asia/">detailed</a> that the new product will provide &ldquo;clients with additional flexibility to trade and hedge their bitcoin price risk.&rdquo; This week, following Bakkt&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/after-breaking-new-records-bakkt-announces-crypto-consumer-app/">recent volume surges</a>, CME published the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/cme-group-futures-exchange/options-bitcoin-futures.html?itm_source=equity_landing_page&itm_medium=top_banner&itm_campaign=2019_bitcoin_options_launch&itm_content=20190920_announcement">preliminary contract specifications</a> for the options. Price values will be based on the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cryptocurrency-indices/cf-bitcoin-reference-rate.html">CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR)</a> which is determined by a variety of major crypto exchanges.</p>

<p>The contract unit will consist of one bitcoin futures contract, which is approximately five <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> quoted in USD. There&rsquo;s a minimum price fluctuation and the listing cycle will mirror the firm&rsquo;s bitcoin futures exposure. CME&rsquo;s bitcoin options on futures will be traded between Sunday through Friday on Globex and Clearport. The company notes that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> options product is subject to revision and review by financial regulators. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working to launch options on those futures,&rdquo; McCourt said to crypto analyst Benjamin Pirus in a <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminPirus/status/1189581739481538560">recent interview</a>. &ldquo;The option on the bitcoin future will give the holder of that option, either a put or a call, the right &mdash; but not necessarily the obligation, to either purchase or sell the underlying futures contracts at maturity.&rdquo; McCourt further stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s very similar to the way other options in the marketplace work. The difference here is the underlying, or the deliverable, of the options contract, is a CME Group bitcoin future.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Is Bitcoin Being &lsquo;Tamed&rsquo; Like a Traditional Investment?</h2>
<p>Bakkt&rsquo;s physically-delivered bitcoin futures product has been getting a lot of fanfare lately after the exchange topped a few new records and CEO Kelly Loeffler <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-announces-bitcoin-options-after-record-breaking-futures-volumes/">announced</a> Bakkt will be offering options on bitcoin futures as well. Despite the all-time highs at the Bakkt warehouse, CME Group&rsquo;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> derivatives have seen much more volume. CME&rsquo;s Globex saw 7,242 bitcoin futures contracts on October 28 and 3,284 in open interest. The following days on Globex through November 1, contracts were between 2,200 and 3,687. November&rsquo;s CME bitcoin futures contracts today stand at 2,641 contracts and December positions are starting to pile up as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-344052" title="CME Group Publishes Bitcoin Options Specifications" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb.jpg" alt="CME Group Publishes Bitcoin Options Specifications" width="1520" height="600" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb.jpg 1520w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-300x118.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-768x303.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-696x275.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-1392x549.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-1068x422.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/futuresbb-1064x420.jpg 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px"></p>
<p>The crypto derivatives markets and products have matured a great deal since they launched and it&rsquo;s been a touch less than two years since CME launched its BTC-based futures. At the time, the company&rsquo;s chairman emeritus Leo Melamed told <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cme-group-bitcoin/bitcoin-a-new-asset-class-not-a-crypto-currency-cmes-melamed-idUSKBN1D712M">Reuters</a> in an interview that adding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> futures was a &ldquo;very important step for bitcoin&rsquo;s history.&rdquo; Melamed added that he believed institutional investors would be very interested in the new asset class. &ldquo;We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We&rsquo;ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.&rdquo; Since then a slew of different companies have offered bitcoin-based derivatives products and futures are coming to other cryptocurrencies like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> as well. Reports detail that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-futures-expected-to-open-up-us-market-by-q1-2020/">BCH futures</a> are expected to debut on a CFTC-regulated exchange in Q1 2020.</p>

<p>To what was considered as the &ldquo;dot-com bubble&rdquo; in the year 2000, Blockchain technology has become as sensationalised and disruptive as the internet was in the late 1990s. Even though the technology is still in its infancy stage, individuals and corporate bodies are already leveraging on it to expand their business and shift their paradigm.</p>
<p>People are more eager to embrace the changes that the future holds, which has given birth to many groundbreaking innovations. While many industry giants were at first skeptical and others were indifferent about the disruptive power of Blockchain, the fear of being left behind seems to be a compelling force to join the Blockchain wave at the moment.</p>
<p>This has seen the likes of JP Morgan, Facebook and Twitter looking in this direction. Needless to say, many countries are already exploring possible ways that Blockchain can aid healthcare, education and finance, whilst also improving the supply chain across various other industries.</p>
<p>As these sectors gain further recognition and with the elimination of other 3rd parties involved in this process, P2P networks have grown stronger than before. For efficiency, decentralisation and reduced risks, many Blockchain financial corporations have already utilised the P2P distribution networks due to its numerous benefits.</p>
<p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks became known during the 1990s. Adopted by sites such as Napster, Gnutella, Limewire and Kazaa, P2P made many music-loving teens happy because they could share and download their digitised music files.</p>
<p>Today, the same concept has been replicated on Blockchain, but in a much more improved way. Many big players are already exploring a better way to efficiently leverage Blockchain technology for an efficient and reliable P2P distribution system. One such notable mention comes from the Kuverit Blockchain project.</p>
<p>Kuverit is a modern, next-generation P2P blockchain project. It offers its users a Guarantee Platform built on top of Blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the&ldquo;Multi-Trader Marketplace&rdquo; is how it&rsquo;s designed to protect its users from the potential of a financial loss in any form of two-way transaction.The platform&rsquo;s technology and inner systems provides more than one way for its users to protect themselves against financial loss.</p>
<p>By leveraging the essence of P2P distribution networks and Blockchain to solve the problem of theft and various losses associated with day to day monetary transactions, Kuverit has created a unique market differentiation among its contemporary players.</p>
<p>Some recognise Kuverit as the biggest mainstream blockchain project of our generation while others appreciate it as a project with the highest potential for global impact. With a target audience of over 780 Million people, no platform to-date seems to have sparked as much interest in the Crypto-space. The prospects are huge!</p>
<p>Kuverit aims to solve a $3 Trillion, mainstream problem with a global, mainstream solution!</p>
<p>Within this P2P platform, optimal security of end user funds is a top priority. To this end, the platform infrastructure has been constructed to ensure a viable and secure environment that will protect users against financial loss as a result of fraudulent activities.<br>
This concept is made possible through its &ldquo;Guarantee Trading Platform&rdquo;.</p>
<p>According to Kuverit&rsquo;s Whitepaper, the feature is available to both individual and corporate entities who need a Guarantee on a two-way transaction.</p>
<p>How the guarantee process works is simple.</p>
<p>The risk is taken by a Guarantor (in exchange for a small fee) who will provide a cast iron assurance that should your transaction end badly and you sustain a financial loss, then you will be &ldquo;Kuvered&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Reputation is a very important aspect of the Kuverit platform.</p>
<p>Just like eBay, which allows users to check the reputation of the other party in the transaction before the transaction takes place, the same reputational scoring system will be replicated on the Kuverit platform.</p>
<p>Lack of basic technical knowledge or ease of access has been identified as one major setback to newcomers joining or utilising the Blockchain ecosystem. Most Blockchain platforms are thought to be generally complex, which may not be entirely wrong. However, Kuverit solves this challenge by providing a seamless, user-friendly platform to improve the onboarding and navigating through the platform. According to critics, it is currently on track to become one of the top 15 crypto asset holdings globally.</p>
<p>In the near future, the Kuverit Business Development team aims to negotiate with established platforms such as eBay, Amazon, Gumtree and AirBnB (to name a few) for an integrated partnership and collaboration. In doing so will allow these established platforms to offer a new layer of protection to their users and aid in the exponential growth of the Kuverit user-base in the mainstream market. This is why Kuverit refer to themselves as building the &ldquo;Amazon of Guarantees&rdquo;. It will not take long for Kuverit to become a household brand!</p>
<p>The emergence of the P2P networking and the central role it plays within Blockchain technology in particular could be seen as welcoming a new system of communication, which offers optimal trust and security to both participating entities be it individuals or business organisations.</p>
