<p>SEBAX &ldquo;is a dynamic, risk-optimized index with a broad market exposure of the crypto asset market,&rdquo; the bank described. Its objective &ldquo;is to provide an investable index for the most secure, reliable and tradable crypto assets,&rdquo; MVIS detailed. &ldquo;The selection of the constituents is monitored on an ongoing basis. The index applies advanced techniques to reduce concentration into single constituents and to deliver enhanced diversification.&rdquo;</p>

Source: MVIS</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to its fact sheet, the index was established on July 2 and currently has five components that are rebalanced monthly. It is calculated daily with the constituent prices converted to USD. A maximum of eight crypto assets ranked by market capitalization are selected for inclusion in the index. MVIS has contracted with Cryptocompare Data Ltd. to maintain and calculate the index. In November, the index components are 48.46% <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, 26.70% <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, 18.28% <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, 3.43% <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>, and 3.13% <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a>.</p>
<p>Crypto assets have to meet specific criteria to be eligible for the index and must rank within the top 30 coins by market capitalization. &ldquo;Stable coins and privacy coins are excluded,&rdquo; MVIS explained. Also excluded are crypto assets with less 90 days of pricing history, those that are not listed on any of the eligible exchanges, and those that fail the index&rsquo;s technical maturity and safety criteria.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Key Loan Rates Lose 5 Basis Points</h2>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) cut a key interest rate last week, part of continuous efforts to shore up the economy. The Chinese central bank lowered the its one-year loan prime rate by just five basis points, true to its strategy to loosen monetary policy in incremental steps. The benchmark rate, state-run lenders were instructed to take as a reference value, went down from October&rsquo;s 4.20 to the current 4.15%. The five-year prime rate, used to determine rates on new mortgages, also lost five basis points to 4.80%.</p>

<p>PBOC applied the same five-basis-point step to decrease its one-year medium-term lending facility, at which it provides funds to other banks, to 3.25% as Reuters reported in early November, as well as its seven-day reserve repo used to inject liquidity into the banking system. These measures were described in a report by the South China Morning Post as &ldquo;fine-tuning of economic stimulus&rdquo; and a &ldquo;series of small steps,&rdquo; an indication of the government&rsquo;s believe that the growth slowdown may hit bottom next year, at around 6%. That could happen if a trade deal is reached with the U.S. before the 2020 presidential election there.</p>
<p>In October, new lending in China fell to its lowest level this year and during a credit analysis conference it sponsored, the People&rsquo;s Bank ordered Chinese lenders to better serve the real economy. It&rsquo;s unlikely, however, that these marginal rate cuts are going to bring a substantial change in China&rsquo;s economic outlook and many observers expect the PBOC to move further in the same direction. But there&rsquo;s a chance that the &lsquo;small steps&rsquo; might turn out to be wrong, as has already happened in the West where interest rate cuts have not revived growth but have created bubbles instead.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Does China Have the Money?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a detailed report has been published by Statista, exploring the state of the Chinese money market and providing an idea about the financial resources the People&rsquo;s Republic has at its disposal. The data shows that in 2018 the money reserves held by the PBOC had reached approximately 33.1 trillion yuan ($4.7 trillion) and its gold reserves amounted to 59.56 million ounces. This year China&rsquo;s reserve position in the International Monetary Fund increased from $8.49 billion to $8.51 billion, as of October.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar remains the most traded currency in China&rsquo;s foreign exchange market, followed by the euro and the yen. But with China&rsquo;s currency reserves reaching $3.07 trillion at the end of 2018 and the country&rsquo;s growing share in global trade, the importance of the Chinese fiat has been increasing. The yuan is now directly convertible to a growing number of other national currencies and even accepted by major oil exporters such as Iran, for example. Beijing and Moscow have been working to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar with Russia planning to issue a yuan-denominated bond as early as this year. Several Russian banks have already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-banks-join-chinese-swift-is-the-dollar-era-under-threat/">joined</a> China&rsquo;s version of Swift.</p>
<figure id="attachment_350075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350075" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350075 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_694307992.jpg" alt="&lsquo;In Small Steps&rsquo; China Cuts Benchmark Interest Rates" width="1000" height="506" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_694307992.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_694307992-300x152.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_694307992-768x389.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_694307992-696x352.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_694307992-830x420.jpg 830w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350075" class="wp-caption-text">Yuan notes and coins</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Statista, the M2 supply in China, including not only cash and checking deposits but also less liquid assets such as savings, amounted to 182.67 trillion yuan at the end of 2018. With signs of a growing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liquidity-difficulties-in-china-second-bank-bail-out-now-reality/">liquidity crisis</a> and even a couple of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-bank-run-highlights-chinas-brewing-financial-crisis/">bank runs</a>, however, the financial sector is likely to create more trouble for Beijing next year. Since 2017, when bank deposits were at 169.3 trillion yuan ($24 trillion at current exchange rate), a number of banks have failed to file their annual reports. While interest on deposit accounts has remained generally low, around 1.5% in 2018 and 1.75% on one-year deposits in 2019, many small banks have been finding it hard to access credit on the interbank lending market, where the weighted average interest rate reached 2.55% in September. In order to preserve liquidity, some of them have been forced to increase interest payments on deposits to over 4%, raising questions about sustainability.</p>
<p>It has become clear that the PBOC will not closely follow in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. China is likely to bet more on fiscal rather than monetary policy next year, boosting government investment in the economy instead of cutting interest rates indefinitely, as already indicated by Premier Li Keqiang. A Politburo <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-chinas-new-fascination-with-blockchain-really-good-for-bitcoin/">speech</a> by the President of China, Xi Jinping, revealed that blockchain development will be a key area of interest for Beijing. And while the yuan&rsquo;s share in <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">bitcoin trading</a> volume remains low since the 2017 crackdown on crypto exchanges &ndash; it constituted 0.1% of bitcoin transactions globally as of August 2018, according to Statista &ndash; blockchain expenditure in China has been projected to grow from $83 million in 2017 to a forecasted $1.42 billion by 2022 and a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/holders-of-the-digital-yuan-will-not-be-paid-interest/">digital yuan</a> is in the making.</p>
<p>The economic and financial agenda of the most populous country will be determined during the upcoming Central Economic Work Conference, an annual meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council towards the end of the year. The forum usually takes place behind closed doors and the people of the People&rsquo;s Republic will learn their government&rsquo;s 2020 growth target sometime next spring.</p>

<p><em>**The following article is an opinion piece written in 2002 by the libertarian author Robert Vroman. Vroman is well known for his editorial work writing for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030213085418/http://www.antistate.com/">anti-state.com</a>. &lsquo;The Jim Bell System Revisited&rsquo; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030212135325/http://www.anti-state.com/article.php?article_id=295">first published on anti-state.com on August 15, 2002,</a> in response to &ldquo;The Jim Bell System&rdquo; debate. This is the second installment of the series written by Vroman.

<p>I also want to point out some areas where I think Jim Bell is completely off base. First of all, his insistence that AP is somehow residing in a loophole of the American legal system that only he is aware of, is absurd, as rightly pointed out by many of his critics. I have no delusions that AP would somehow survive its &ldquo;day in court&rdquo; or that even if, due to some arcane technicality, AP is a legal enterprise that that would stop the State from pursuing it relentlessly. Furthermore, I am mystified by Bell&rsquo;s fascination with confrontation and martyrdom (as exemplified by his personal life) and do not think AP will be started by the self-sacrificing, or that it&rsquo;s even necessarily a good idea to have that mindset when designing the system. Bell also overestimates the enthusiasm that ordinary people will have for AP by a long shot. I still have reasons to believe there will sufficient customers, but they are not going to be primarily heartland regular Joes, who Bell envisions watching AP&rsquo;s deadly progress with amusement. Bell also gives some slightly cockeyed responses to a number of objections to his invention. In fact really the main thing I take away from his writing is the system itself, not necessarily any of his justifications.</p>
<p>My friend and business partner, Bob Murphy presented some powerhouse arguments against my pet theory in our recent columnist debate over the infamous Assassination Politics concept. I contend that under closer examination, his insightful questions can be answered satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adam Young has presented a thoroughly researched historical analysis against AP, which I will address first.</p>
<p>Young has three main points. First, that assassination has been ineffectual in the past for destroying states. Second, assassinations will instead create a backlash against anarchism by government and citizens alike. Third, he does not like the moral implications of the very likely possibility of collateral damage from sloppy AP prize-hunters, given the relatively poor caliber of historical attempts.</p>

<p>The first point, despite all its exhaustive research, is I&rsquo;m afraid to say, totally erroneous because the mechanism by which AP kills its victims is fundamentally different then assassination campaigns of the past. I am not at all surprised to read that a handful of suicidal ideologues gunning down a few unlucky aristocrats failed to exorcise the nation state. Assume for the moment that AP&rsquo;s basic functions materialize (I will get to Murphy&rsquo;s objections later). The pool of assassins has instantaneously expanded from only insane political extremists, to every single violent opportunist in the world who can access a computer. AP represents a veritable full scale war against the State, fought by the scum of society and funded by every partisan malcontent across the political spectrum. A dozen assassinations per century is certainly not going to give any politicians second thoughts about their career choice, any more than the dozen or so plane hijackings in the past 50 years makes me nervous seeing a turban in business class. However, logically speaking there must be some tipping point at which the body count is the most pressing statistic a politician has in mind. AP will surpass this tipping point, where history&rsquo;s basket case revolutionaries were doomed to fail. The State will, of course, respond in nasty ways, but inevitably these will prove ineffective in the face of an impenetrable network supporting a sustained and widespread offensive.</p>
<p>Secondly, Young fears that AP will re-enforce the stereotype of anarchists as the 19th-century mad bomber and 20th century Starbucks arsonist. This will then erase any chance of our winning hearts and minds via soul-stirring online essays, and worst of all, get the lot of us gulagged.</p>
<p>What he fails to realize is the absolute lack of a reason for there to be any connection between anarchists and AP. If AP were actually launched, I for one would certainly not be publicly cheering it on (I probably wouldn&iacute;t even risk staying in the country, having written this article). The people who will be donating will not be doing so for anarchist reasons, they will not assume they are furthering anarchism, they will not make the connection. The targets also, will not probably be prioritized as an anarchist would. Ancaps are too small a group for our bets (if any) to be a major impact, thus if occasional bettors are caught, they are statistically unlikely to be one of us. The assassins will also not be Ancaps, unless any of you have a mercenary streak you&iacute;re not revealing. If all goes well the admins will either not exist or remain anonymous, and thus their political angle is irrelevant.</p>
<p>With no anarchists predominantly involved in any of the core functions of AP, or visibly supporting it, I don&rsquo;t see why Young thinks that the State will blame anarchists for the rise of AP. In fact, if my predictions are correct, the assassins will primarily be the existing criminal class. If the State picks any scapegoats, it will be black militancy, or drug users, or the militia movement, etc, i.e. the people who are actually attacking them. The Government did not condemn anarchists for WTC, they blamed Islamic fundamentalists. Ancaps aren&rsquo;t being rounded up in detention camps, Arabs are. Despite the fact that anarchists have often said things in the aftermath that amount to &ldquo;they had it coming to them.&rdquo; Which is more or less what I&iacute;m saying here. Anarchists will have just as much to do with AP as they did with WTC. The people who are going to suffer the brunt of the State&rsquo;s reaction are the actual instigators of violence, and if I read my audience correctly, that will not be any of you. Do you particularly care (aside from general aversion to Statist crusades) if the State launches a crusade against crack heads and professional killers?</p>
<p>If the non-betting population experiences revulsion from AP at work, its outrage will be directed at a disparate collection of political interests and unrelated thugs. The State will undoubtedly ramp up its enforcement regime in response to AP, however, there is no reason that anarchists would be singled out, when there are more direct threats available.</p>
<p>If the State does pick Anarcho-Capitalists as the source of all evil, instead of some other arbitrary group like, say the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030212135325/http://www.greenpanthers.org/">Republic of Ganjastan</a>, then I advise us all to leave or prepare to be martyrs. At some point, things are going to get uncomfortable for non-statists whether it&rsquo;s Ashcroft Inc&rsquo;s regularly scheduled programming, or an AP frenzy whipped totalitarian drive. I plan to be an ex-pat at that time in either case. We can always come back in the aftermath, and start the equivalent of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030212135325/http://www.awdal.com/">Awdal Roads Company</a> in the former US of A.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of collateral damage, which can be creatively ameliorated within the AP protocol. Its conceivable AP players might get in the habit of waiting for a number of high priced targets to get in the same building, and then truck bombing the whole structure to claim multiple big prizes, without concern for the dozens of non-targets cut down along the way. The moral failure here, I believe, lies solely with the assassin. However, my opinion is irrelevant, because if the bettors themselves feel they are responsible and they have a conscience, they will not bet for fear that the target they put money on will take a hundred un-targeted coworkers down with him. Thus AP needs to alleviate the moral obstacles bettors will face in order to have the maximum revenue flow possible. The answer is to allow for pools to be started with any number of stipulations. For example, the prize for politician Z might include the following rule:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any bystanders are killed in the death of the target, 90% of the prize money will be donated to a fund for their next of kin. The remaining 10% will be distributed evenly to correct guessers via the normal method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or some such wording that would serve to greatly motivate the assassin to be careful in planning his attack.</p>
<p>By this scheme, there could be multiple prize pools for the same target, each with different disclaimers. For example, in addition to the 90% victim payout pool for Mr. Z, there might be a no questions asked pool for the same guy. Presumably, the fewer rules there are attached to the prize, the more likely an assassin will be to take a chance at winning it. Thus bettors have to balance their moral qualms about collateral damage versus their desire to see results. If they care more about bystanders, they should bet into the rules heavy pool, if they care more about eliminating the target, bet into the open ended pool.</p>
<p>Unless there is overwhelmingly more money in the &ldquo;kill by any means&rdquo; pool, the mere existence of the &ldquo;kill carefully&rdquo; pool, should convince the assassin to be as discrete as possible so as to win both prizes. So even if AP bettors are on the whole more bloodthirsty than socially conscious, the few with some scruples will be able to have a large impact on how AP players go about their operations. In fact if AP players really did tend toward wanton destruction in order to hit their marks, it might be in the best interest of people, who either exist in close proximity to a top target, or have a general compassion for bystanders, to bet into the constrained pool, even if they have no desire to see the target dead, but for no other reason than to be sure that when he does die, the assassin will hopefully be motivated by the money in the conditional pool and avoid civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Young denounces AP on the grounds that it uses a tactic of the State, i.e. &ldquo;terror&rdquo;, against the State itself, and this is a reprehensible flaw. Saying that AP is terror because it kills tyrants, is like saying shooting a mugger is terror. Well, yes. If you were unfortunate enough to live in a neighborhood inhabited by gangs, and got a reputation for shooting harassers without hesitation, this would effectively &ldquo;terrorize&rdquo; the gangsters into leaving you in peace, or so goes the &ldquo;armed society is a polite society&rdquo; school of thought.</p>
<p>However, AP does not even qualify as terror in the political sense.</p>
<p>The precise political science definition of terrorism is &ldquo;a group that uses force against an intermediate target in order to bring about a desired decision from an ultimate target&rdquo;. In other words, a terrorist is ill-equipped to directly attack the hated government, so instead he blows up a school bus, and issues a public ultimatum that unless the government meets some of his petty demands he will strike again. The logic being that the government is incapable of protecting every school bus all the time, and the terrorist has nothing else to do but plan his next bombing, so he can essentially strike at will. He hopes that eventually the State will tire of this harassment and acquiesce, usually because the population becomes exasperated at the government&iacute;s ineffectual attempts to stop the attacks, and it is in danger of losing its power, not due to any compassion for the school kids.</p>
<p>AP does not follow this model, primarily because, unlike the terrorist, it can indeed strike the ultimate targets directly and does not need to play deadly games with intermediate symbols. If anything, AP should be described as guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Even if the effects of AP end up being terrorist in the popular sense, this is wholly different from say Al Quaeda plotting together in some dusty bunker. AP is a decentralized system unlike anything ever before. Without a central decision making body like a terrorist cell, the targets selected by the AP patronizing public will reflect its user&rsquo;s ideologies. AP will only use explicitly terrorist tactics, if its users overwhelmingly have terrorist inclinations themselves, which given the superior abilities provided by AP, is an unproductive course of action and a waste of money.</p>

<p>I hope that is a decent response to Young&rsquo;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030212135325/http://www.anti-state.com/young/young2.html">excellent article</a>. On to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060505223110/http://www.anti-state.com/article.php?article_id=289">Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s piece</a>.</p>
<p>First Murphy doubts the feasibility of AP with the very legitimate concern that if the system were truly an impenetrable secret to all investigators, there is nothing stopping the AP operators from pocketing all the donations, yet claiming winners had been paid, resting on the impossibility of discovery, and the robbed winner&rsquo;s desire to remain anonymous (since he&rsquo;s probably got blood on his hands). A better scam might involve creating artificially high bounties, and then only paying out what&rsquo;s actually in the pot. Since if there are multiple bets on the same day, the prize is split evenly between them, the assassin will not know if he has been cheated or if there are actually were enough other random guessers to dilute his prize down to the share he actually gets. The administrators could also skim off a healthy chunk too, and no one would be the wiser. This would probably be the best way to for the admins to dishonestly game the system, so that they enrich themselves; the assassins are disappointed but not given proof of treachery; and the bounties are higher than normal, thus enticing more gullible thugs.</p>
<p>So is this really a problem? Seems to me the system still works exactly as planned whether the admins are honest or not. The only problem is getting people to trust the system in the first place, which I&rsquo;ll cover in a minute.</p>
<p>If we assume that the admins&rsquo; purpose in creating AP is to make as fat a profit as possible, then they will not want to blatantly rip off hitmen, for fear that word will inevitably get out among the criminal population that AP isn&iacute;t on the level. However, even in an extreme case where the admins do embezzle every penny, it doesn&iacute;t matter. Since very few people involved with AP will be actually killing anyone, only a tiny minority of users will feel they have been cheated, while the greater number will be convinced they got their money&rsquo;s worth. Thus they will continue to use the system. Future assassins not in communication with their gypped colleagues will also be led to believe others have been paid. Thus everything still works, money goes in, prizes are accumulated, and targets are eliminated.</p>
<p>If the admins really are capable of hiding all evidence and expertly conning the system, then the system will indeed be conned, and so well conned, that it will continue to run despite being conned over and over. The only problem is if this possibility prevents people from ever starting to bet and becoming convinced they are being dealt with fairly.</p>
<p>There are two answers to this: the AP business can slowly build trust with less extreme versions of itself, and also the overlooked fact that people have a surprisingly high tolerance for potentially fraudulent online services.</p>
<p>To establish itself as an authentic operation, AP might be introduced not as a full fledged death machine but instead as a low key betting pool system whereby users could put money on sporting events or guess the day certain celebrities will get divorced, and other trivial wagers. The selling point is the hardcore anonymity feature for users in harsher nanny states. In this relatively low risk phase, winners could have the option of being publicly announced for ego&rsquo;s sake, and this would prove the system operated as intended. Then gradually more and more sinister bets would be allowed until it becomes completely un-moderated and AP is born.</p>
<p>Such a system would not be nipped in the bud, as Murphy predicts, as there are countless underground betting organizations currently in operation, and proto-AP would arguably be even more secure from law enforcement, by benefit of its exclusive existence on the internet with solid encryption and no face to face contact among users. Even at the intermediate semi-morbid phases its possible proto-AP would not garner significant government attention. Look at this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030212135325/http://www.stiffs.com/">http://www.stiffs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly harmless, but the fact it has garnered no legal complaints is a good indicator that real-AP would be able to go on the offensive for some time before the Feds figured out where the threat is coming from.</p>
<p>I also still think the best idea is to design an autonomous system with no publicly identified administrators even in the proto phase, whether this will become feasible with future developments in cryptography remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Even if AP did not go to the trouble of gradually building a customer base, it does not necessarily mean it will fail. Examine the case of online gambling. Here we have people putting their money on games where the &ldquo;house&rdquo; can completely manipulate the odds in its own favor simply by changing a few lines of code, and the user will never know unless he takes detailed notes on winning percentages. They do not even have a reputation at stake like a traditional Las Vegas casino, which could do the same with its electronic slot machines. If a Vegas outfit says its slots payout 99% or something, people who have no good reason to trust that, still play by the thousands. Many people are unaware that the Nevada Gaming Commission even exists, and virtually none have any idea how good a job they do at enforcing gambling regulations. And inexplicably they play online versions of these same dubious games too, where they have far less control, and nowhere near the trust of a &ldquo;reputable&rdquo; brick and mortar casino. Online gambling rakes in millions, despite obvious security holes and opportunities for abuse. An indicator that even if AP is not foolproof as far as protecting bettor&rsquo;s money from the admins, people will still donate and predict. Maybe they&rsquo;re just stupid, and maybe the online casinos are actually honest.</p>
<p>Murphy also points out that if politicians resort to holding Congress inside a NORAD bunker, then any information about deaths inside the mountain can be easily manipulated by the government, thus disrupting the rewarding of correct guessers. I doubt this will be an effective countermeasure against AP. If the outside world never knows that the Feds are lying about death dates, then potential assassins would not be aware their successful hits might be in vain. They would then still have the motivation to mount their attacks, and only afterward realize the government&rsquo;s press corps has cheated them out of their prize. However, the people donating money have still gotten what they want: a dead politician, and thus will continue donating. Since the assassin will presumably either be dead, captured or in hiding, he will not be able to warn anyone that the government is using information warfare against AP. Thus the system continues as planned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it becomes common knowledge that the government is not a reliable source of information, then it will be up to the assassin to make the real death date known. Perhaps acquiring a tissue sample from the victim and anonymously forwarding to independent media, or videotaping the kill shot with some kind of provable date stamp. This means the assassin has to take extra risk in getting close enough to the body to grab some proof, or accidentally providing incriminating evidence on tape, and also risk further exposure in contacting the media. If the AP server is run autonomously, it will have to be programmed to take into account the relative trustworthiness of misinforming government sources versus potentially nutcase indy media, and then make a decision as to the actual date of death. If the information is too ambiguous, then it might extend prize percentages to predictions on neighboring days, based on the probability of being correct. In light of this possibility, the assassin would be smart to take out high interest loans and dump his entire net worth into bets on days all around the planned kill date.</p>

<p>In light of this development, the assassin will have to take more risks and thus insist on a higher prize before taking his chances. Thus this government strategy will only serve to increase the equilibrium price of assassinations, just like their moving into the bunker itself.</p>
<p>Matt Apple brought up a similar potential scam on the forum:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another problem is the targets could fake their deaths. Suppose I&rsquo;m a powerful person you&rsquo;ve targeted. I just buy a day and then fake my death on that day. I put out a phony death certificate, maybe I even provide some gruesome staged photos of me lying dead. The media reports me dead and the operator releases the dough to the &ldquo;guesser&rdquo; ie me. As soon as the anonymous transaction is completed I appear on camera at a live press conference and announce that the plans of the evil electronic terrorists have been foiled and that in an ironic twist I&rsquo;m donating the bounty they had on my head to the FBI. If this happened just once then all the people pumping up those bounties will lose their faith in the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the media is so blatantly lied to, then more so than the AP bettors, the media itself will not believe future death reports. They will want to take pictures at the autopsy or do whatever it takes to have ironclad proof that this guy really is dead. If the media becomes an overt tool of the state, there will still be people who demand an objective news source, whether they are AP sympathizers or not. This demand will support the Matt Drudges of the world who will find a way around mainstream hegemony, and AP can be programmed to ignore statist media.</p>
<p>Murphy doubts that my army of gutter trash will be able to make a dent in the ruling class. Perhaps he&rsquo;s right that the average street hoodlum will only be successful in killing mid level bureaucrats that the State can&rsquo;t afford to lavish security on. However, if that were true, is it really such a crucial flaw? If AP bettors come to realize that the tiptop of the pyramid can find impenetrable missile silos to hide in, then it&rsquo;s no longer cost-effective to chase them with ever higher donations. Like any institution, the State clearly needs support personnel, and even if they do choose to hide in Mt. Cheyenne, they still need people on the ground at the very least to crack heads and collect taxes to keep the lights on down in their hole. If AP bettors become frustrated that the juicy targets are out of range, the next level down is going to take the brunt of it in the face. It might be fun to be a stormtrooper, but if suddenly you, due to lack of options, become the priority target for the assassination market, maybe its time to turn in your badge and go back to a vocational school. Additionally if you are an ordinary citizen who has up to this time not been involved with AP at all, but suddenly you notice that the tax collectors who stay above ground are getting executed with alarming frequency, you might be more inclined to gamble on fudging your returns or not paying at all, and hoping that the constant harassment provided by AP will prevent the revenue harvesters from noticing you.</p>
<p>If the State is denuded of its agents and means of interaction, then it is just as harmless as if it had been chopped up directly.</p>
<p>However, it would naturally be more efficient to strike the root. AP would reach its end goal quickest, with the least collateral damage, if assassins were able to hit the politicians even in their super-bunkers. There&rsquo;s an argument that there is some upper bound beyond which additional funds will no longer influence the odds of an assassination taking place. Meaning that if $500M is not enough to convince anyone to take a chance on the target, $5B probably won&rsquo;t either. That may be the case for individuals, but not for groups of AP players. If a mercenary or terrorist group became interested in mounting a multi-person operation like the WTC attack, then the higher the bounty gets, the more equipment they can buy and more personnel they can recruit for the plan. If say, there were multi-million dollar bounties on Saddam Hussein (a safe example) and all his top generals and lieutenants, making their bunker a concentrated mega bounty, it could become worthwhile for some para-military unit to risk a raid. The highest paid professional mercenaries in the world are employed by Sandline International and, according to the UN (who wants to ban their line of work), they make no more than $300,000/yr. That&rsquo;s not chump change, but for someone who rides shotgun in a chopper chasing down African guerrillas for a living, the extra risk driving into Baghdad might be worth the hazard pay offered by AP.</p>
<p>Taken to its logical conclusion, if there were enough extremely high bounties on a country&rsquo;s leaders, who were all clustered into one spot, no matter how well defended, it could be cost-effective for army sized forces to be mobilized to seize the prize. So even if the top brass did hole up in the ultra bunkers, entire legions of militiamen or other adventurous chaps might come a-knocking to snag all those billions.</p>
<p>Murphy goes on to say that the average Americans will be horrified by the idea of AP. True, the 50% of the population who don&rsquo;t bother to vote probably will not feel their time is well spent influencing the political system by AP or any other method. Of the other half, probably the majority has no deep interest in the issues or understands anything beyond doing one&rsquo;s civic duty. Of that slim percentage that actually has strong to passionate views, whatever they may be, therein lies AP&rsquo;s demographic. What Bob fails to realize is that AP bettors will not know what they are doing, long term. Very few people are going to consciously decide they want to get rid of government and put money on it. Instead, they will donate money against specific politicians in the hope it will help advance whatever pet cause they clutch so dearly. Think if AP were in place back in the 2000 election. Are you a greenie who can&rsquo;t stand the thought of oilman GW raping poor Gaia? Give AP some of your weed money and see what happens. Are you a good ol&rsquo; boy who thinks eco-feminist Al Gore will send the beloved US of A the way of the Roman Empire? Put off buying that new truck and see what AP can do. Even the most authoritarian bastard who ever cast a ballot can list some Statists of a slightly different breed than rub him the wrong way. Do you doubt the gun culture would pass up on an opportunity to bury some liberals, or for the religious right hypocrites to take out some of the godless queers in Washington, or radical feminists putting their 79 cents on the dollar against Deep South carpetbaggers? And more importantly than private citizens, don&rsquo;t forger corporate-statists, like Big Ass Subsidies Inc who&rsquo;s pocket politician might lose to the candidate who&rsquo;s platform calls to spend the loot on some other boondoggle. Surely they can afford a million dollar write off if their spot in line at the trough is at risk.</p>
<p>The point is that maybe Mrs. Soccer Mom has no strong opinions and would never think of placing a bet, but there are many, many people with strong political views, regardless of what they are. Surely the more diehard or less moral will see that they increase the chances of their guy winning, if the enemy is scared off by a rising AP tab.</p>
<p>And the boiling frog effect comes into play as AP makes its mark on the world. When the state predictably increases its enforcement measures, more people will see it in their best interest to bet against encroaching fascists.</p>

<p>If you doubt Americans will buy into this system in relevant numbers, I will repeat the point from my first article that Murphy did not address. I can concede that Americans will refuse to play, or that the Feds will manage to protect themselves (I don&rsquo;t) but that does not mean AP cannot be effective. Ignore the NATO countries for a minute. Imagine AP taking root in some exotic locale like Nigeria for example. I bet a lot of those relatively well to do white farmers might take the opportunity to go online and put some money against Mugabe. I also think that one of his sadistic henchmen might be able to do the math to see that the AP prize is greater than his entire combined future earnings. The downside of the Third World is the lack of communications infrastructure, but in the coming years, ever cheaper electronics will make that less and less of an obstacle. The upside, of course, is that the leaders are rather absurdly unashamed of their predations, and very frequently there are large contingents of people who adamantly hate them. Furthermore add that these States have less sophisticated means of combating online activity it disproves of, and the fact that the population is used to politicians forcefully attempting to grab the throne. The conclusion is that many of the potential objections that apply to America and the &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; world are not to be found at all south of the equator. This could be an interesting testbed for the protocol. If it works, we get another blossoming Somalia. If it fails, well, the country was a hellhole before anyway.</p>
<p>Murphy says that if AP works well enough to destroy the state, it won&iacute;t stop there and will completely shred civilization.</p>
<p>He claims for example that just as disgruntled citizens can axe politicians at will, laid-off workers can axe their cost cutting former employers and that any defenses the private individuals can use, will be even easier for the state to use.</p>
<p>This is wrong on both counts. Not only is it harder for capitalists to be killed, they can defend themselves from AP easier.</p>
<p>First of all, there are vastly more high ranking business owners than there are high ranking bureaucrats. If the AP betting population suddenly gained an all consuming irrational desire to destroy capitalism, it would take a far greater monetary investment against businessmen than politicians, to reach that tipping point where targets are scared away from their positions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each individual businessman has a much smaller pool of people affected by his decisions. Whereas everyone in the country has to deal with the onerous decrees of the gang in Washington, there are many orders of magnitude fewer people dependent on any given board of directors. Presumably, people who don&rsquo;t work for that company will not be very inclined to donate money, just as not many Americans would bet against Italian party chiefs. Therefore if the boss does manage to royally piss off the workers, he has much fewer potential bettors against him. These are people who have just lost their source of income (with no welfare to look forward to), and have fewer co-conspirators; they will not be able to produce nearly as enticing bounties as those that public officials will accrue. Keep in mind that people who bet against politicians will be expecting their incomes to rise in the absence of taxes, and thus be more likely to bet higher.</p>
<p>More importantly, the boss knows who they are. If murder is being considered it&rsquo;s likely due to them being whipped into a fury by some mafia goon union boss. The CEO has much more money at his disposal than an unemployed working class gang. If the union leader agitates his followers to wreak AP based revenge against the CEO, he can&iacute;t expect to survive either. Anyone who attempts to rally workers to donate their already dwindling cash reserves into pointless vengeance will see his own name rising on the list faster than the CEO&rsquo;s. The population of an entire state will be large enough that the number of independent people willing to put money against their powerful enemies will not require there be anyone egging them on. In order for smaller interest groups to get their petty revenge, a more coordinated effort is required. Harder still is that the potential victims have a much more conveniently sized body of suspects to watch, compared to politicians who are being targeted by anonymous bettors hiding among millions or billions.</p>
<p>And better still, if the CEO knows whom he fired and who is threatening him, then everyone else knows as well. Would you hire workers who had paid for the assassination of their last employer? If a group of people are fired and their ex-boss is subsequently the target of a fat AP prize, then the entire group will immediately be blacklisted by every other employer. This will provide a huge incentive for individual workers not to toe the union line. Their own reputation and future employability rests on breaking their professional relations civilly or at least without bloodshed.</p>
<p>This situation might instead just serve to impress upon corporations the need to be more careful in their hiring and firing. Only take on workers you really need, and only let them go after careful consideration, and in that event, possibly firing them in smaller batches, rather than mass layoffs. Nevertheless, this may indeed grant more power to workers. We must remember that not all corporations are nobly building wealth in spite of government machinations. Occasionally there really are scumbags who abuse employees, is it such a disaster if such people fear lethal retaliation for their misdeeds?</p>
<p>Another dystopian fear is that AP will support murders between non-famous people over petty frustrations. A scumbag husband wants to get out of a divorce without losing half his wealth, so if he thinks an AP bet worth a quarter of his wealth will get the job done, and does so. An unrelated party kills the wife, scumbag cuts his losses nicely, and the wife is horrendously aggressed against with no chance of justice for her family.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a problem that AP would exacerbate. Choosing your spouse carefully has always been good advice. However, if the wife&rsquo;s lawyers checked the AP records and found there had been a substantial prize, despite her being a generally well liked individual, they would decide that the &ldquo;unrelated&rdquo; killer might not be such a random tragedy after all. And proceed to hire detectives to investigate the ex-husband&rsquo;s financial records to find a similarly sized hole. Even if he expertly hid all his transactions with encryption and such, the sheer lack of other suspects may lead an arbitration committee to demand the husband prove his innocence. I assume hiring an assassin to initiate aggression will be a crime in Ancapland, but I will let others debate that.</p>
<p>Like the threatened businessman who knows who his potential threats are, in the case of an innocuous unknown being the victim of AP, it will be easy to discover the few or single person that has the motivation to invest the significant money involved. AP, in fact, hurts the chances of the anonymous petty murderer, because the record of one&rsquo;s prize is public. Anyone who cares to investigate the death of an AP victim can see exactly how much it cost. If the victim had few enemies, it is a simple matter to make the connection between the specific sum and the likely suspects.</p>
<p>Compare this to the case of a low level bureaucrat that Murphy complains is just as vulnerable as the rest of us. He is right in saying that it doesn&rsquo;t require one big bet, only lots of little bets. However, unless the bureaucrat has managed to piss off all those people placing the little bets, they won&rsquo;t happen, and he is safe. If the bureaucrat has managed to do so then there&rsquo;s probably a reason he deserves it. People in the phone book though, probably do not have multitudes of enemies, and thus are safe from all but an exceptionally wealthy psychopath, which I imagine are few and far between.</p>
<p>As for the extortion scheme that Jim Bell rather awkwardly argued against and Bob accurately deflated. The problem there is that the extortionist needs to have enough money of his own to actually place the bet that will attract assassins to his victim.</p>
<p>Fortunately, extortionists usually ply their trade because they don&rsquo;t have any money. The thug could bluff, but if called on it, he has no bargaining chips in this case, like an old fashioned significant other duct-taped in the basement.</p>
<p>If he actually does have the money and the victim calls his bluff, if he goes through with his threat, he has just spent a shit load of money to kill someone for no reason, and with no return benefit to the extortionist. Not a very profitable scam.</p>
<p>If he does convince the target to play along, he still has to communicate his threat. Such exchanges usually involve some amount of negotiation, or complicated instructions that require communication. The extortionist has to sacrifice a lot of anonymity to pull his crime off. This weakness gives the presumably deep pocketed target plenty of opportunities to spend some of that ransom on private detectives to locate the extortionist. The criminal, in this case, has no human shields to prevent a raid.</p>
<p>The benefit of AP is to allow anonymous assassination contracts, in both the case of the vengeful labor leader, and the crafty extortionist, both lose that shield and leave themselves wide open to retaliation from the greater resources of their chosen enemies.</p>
<p>Another concern mentioned on the forum, is that the State, with its trillions of revenue will actually invest money into AP to off its political opponents. This is a pretty ridiculous proposal.</p>
<p>First of all, the enemies of your enemies are not necessarily your friends. If the State pays an AP assassin to shoot some, say, ultra-lefty criticizing them, are we really that much worse off? In fact, I&rsquo;d be overjoyed to see politicians taking out AP bets against their opponents for the most part. Why should a democrat spend valuable campaign money on advertising when he could just pay to have his republican opponent drop out of the race permanently? Libertarians are rare enough that I doubt we present a serious enough threat to the State compared to their fellow parasites scrambling for the best suck spot, that they&iacute;d spend money to attack Harry Browne instead of their opponent in the primary who has a real chance of ousting them.</p>
<p>Another problem with this supposed counter strategy is that it&rsquo;s entirely unnecessary. If the State really wants to kill someone, they already have all the tools; they don&rsquo;t need to spend money on AP. They could just give Lon Horiuchi his normal paycheck and have him snipe whoever they don&rsquo;t like. It&rsquo;s not as if they ever get in trouble for it, even when they aren&rsquo;t exactly subtle. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for them to pay for secrecy they don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>Finally, this plan would backfire, because if the admins are anarchists, and they take a commission, then the State, by playing AP, is directly enriching someone who will re-invest his profit against State targets. Also, the assassins don&iacute;t care who they kill if the money&rsquo;s right. The State is also enriching people who will be just as happy to come back and shoot Statists, now with more resources to plan hits too.</p>
<p>Bob concluded by essentially saying that the only way to anarchy is an enormous campaign of rational evangelism. He disapproves of the whirlwind anarchy in Somalia and similar power vacuums. I disagree. I see much more hope for building Ancapland out of the lawless ashes of a Somalia, than of gradually subliming the promised land out of the monolithic State in an America. If AP does prove the alarmists right, and crashes society into an apocalyptic period, (I do not think this is the case) still, such a turn of events will be in the long run an easier path to Ancapism than the intellectual erosion strategy. Murphy points out the example of the bloodless revolutions in Eastern Europe. To which I respond derisively, what revolution? They traded hard-line Russki-communism for soft line Euro-socialism. That&rsquo;s even more of a joke than American style Republicrat lesser-evilism. Stasi agents all retired on embezzled millions, and now the Great Terror War is inviting domestic espionage back in force all across the Continent. The only revolution that arguably has ever made recognizable progress is the American experiment, which is notable for killing employees of the previous regime by the thousand. If Thomas Jefferson could have emailed digicash to pub brawlers in London, or scheming heirs in Buckingham palace, mad King George&rsquo;s confused reign would have come to a deserved end before he could futilely attempt to reclaim his rebellious colonies. The point being, in order to get anarchism, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question of getting the balls to start sledge hammering the Berlin Wall and hope the Kalishnikov toting border guard respects the numbers presented by all your fellow civil disobeyers. If the only fall out is a different set of thugs being in charge tomorrow, there will, of course, be less State resistance than if the entire thug industry is being called into question. If you want real change as in no more thugs, ever, then the top thugs aren&rsquo;t going to budge until they have no other choice. The ultimate conclusion then is that if anarchism takes a revolution of the non-bloodless variety, there&rsquo;s no reason why the fighters shouldn&rsquo;t be backed up by a means to get at the higher ups. Or better yet, replace the fighters entirely with anonymous assassins and strike exclusively at the heights of power. I know I don&rsquo;t want to spend much time huddling in trenches.</p>
<p>It undoubtedly sounds arrogant, but I would say that less than 1% of the global population has any concept of how the world (i.e. economics) really works, and of those that do, most have got it horribly wrong. However, when they are forced to suddenly make do for themselves in the absence of authority, as is the case of Somalia, Ancapism spontaneously appears without the presence of wise graduate student mentors preaching Mises. It sure would be nice, naturally, if Bob could go over and warn them off from accepting UN overtures of providing &ldquo;stable governance&rdquo;, but the point is they were able to find profitable anarchism on their own, with little to no knowledge of economics and certainly no deep respect for pacifism. All it took was the total destruction of their state, the means notwithstanding. On the other hand, if Murphy expects to get some percentage of the population to side with him before picking up a hammer, he will definitely be taking the long uphill route.</p>
<p>Murphy says that a generation growing up surrounded by headlines full of dead famous people will be disastrous. I fail to see how this could be more damaging than the scores of generations stretching back into history that grew up with headlines of how great the State is. The Somalians lived through generations of war, where life was made quite cheap, yet now they are Africa&rsquo;s best chance.</p>
<p>If AP worked perfectly and stripped the state away by force in a relatively short time frame, people will be thrust into unfamiliar territory. No doubt in their confusion they will attempt to recreate State functions. These will be torn down again and again. Like a child getting its hand slapped every time it reaches for the hot stove, AP will discipline the world that concentrations of power are bad. In the meantime, if Murphy is able to patiently explain to the bewildered why this is the case, so much the better, but either way, there will be no more State, and they will not have a choice in the matter. Murphy is essentially advocating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030212135325/http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/%7Etcs">Taking Children Seriously</a> approach to enlightening the collectively childlike population. I would rather just smack them until they stop and maybe explain briefly afterward why.</p>
<p>Lastly, it seems clear to me that AP is superior because it is a market process. People exchange value for perceived value. They invest their money for the benefit of removing aggressive people from society. On the other hand, Murphy is advocating an &ldquo;educate the masses&rdquo; routine that depends solely on him and his colleague&rsquo;s dedication to the cause. Not to disparage his efforts, honestly, if anyone can do it, the current crop of anarchist intellectuals has got my fullest confidence. However, I really don&rsquo;t think anyone is going to listen until they are already living in it. I see the economic wizard&rsquo;s role as after the fact guides in the new wonderful world of anarchism wrought by AP and other market strategies. Once everyone is stuck in their regional equivalents of Somalia, and wondering what the hell just happened, Bob and co, will step in and say, &ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t this great, look how much more we can get done now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And people, who have been forced to find alternatives to formerly government offered services, and no longer obey regulations or sacrifice taxable income, will sit up and finally notice Bob, and say, &ldquo;What the fuck? Why haven&rsquo;t we always done this? Thanks, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob will then smile knowingly and go on a world wide lecture tour.</p>
<p>Then from time to time, a few clueless bastards will try to &ldquo;get all the guns and take over&rdquo;. AP will mercilessly smite them. Life goes on. In the meantime, I await the next round of objections.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">New Silk Road Documentary Discusses How Ross Ulbricht Handed the Reins Over to Another Individual</h2>
<p>Since the Silk Road marketplace was seized and Ross Ulbricht incarcerated, many facets of the case have remained a mystery to this day. The video published on Youtube on November 26 by the nonprofit organization Freeross.org tries to unravel some of the riddles behind the Silk Road investigation. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NZxivue5Ng&feature=youtu.be">Silk Road Case: The Real, Untold Story</a>&rdquo; contains information that has never been publicly released before as well as underreported information from sources derived from various subjects, court filings, transcripts, trial exhibits, and affidavits.</p>

<p>When Ross started the Silk Road, he called it a &ldquo;free-market economic experiment&rdquo; and he wholeheartedly believed &ldquo;people should have the right to buy and sell whatever they wanted, so long as they weren&rsquo;t hurting anyone else.&rdquo; Just a few months after the market launch, the news outlet gawker.com published an article about the Silk Road, which went viral and eventually reached the ears of politicians and law enforcement. New York Senator Chuck Schumer called for immediate action against the Silk Road marketplace and at the time, it was called the &lsquo;Schumer&rsquo;s case.&rsquo;</p>
<figure id="attachment_350007" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350007" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350007 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="674" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq.jpeg 900w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq-80x60.jpeg 80w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq-160x120.jpeg 160w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq-696x521.jpeg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1zq8tlbo_z62niq1zhuc5dq-561x420.jpeg 561w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350007" class="wp-caption-text">Ross Ulbricht&rsquo;s laptop at a museum.

<p>Because Ross lacked the technical knowledge and programming abilities to run a marketplace as large as the Silk Road, he started asking friends for help. A close friend didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with the market, so Ross turned to an anonymous individual. &ldquo;A stranger provided the needed help and eventually took control of the site entirely,&rdquo; the video&rsquo;s narrator highlights. Moreover, the unknown Silk Road leader did an interview with the press shortly after Ross handed the market over. &ldquo;I was in his corner from early on and eventually it made sense for me to take the reins,&rdquo; the new DPR explained during his interview. In November 2011 following the transition, Ross told his close friend in an online chat room:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Glad that&rsquo;s not my problem anymore.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most people are unaware that after Ross gave up the reins, the new unknown leader of the Silk Road announced his infamous screen name on February 6, 2012. The newly appointed administrator told the public his name was the &ldquo;Dread Pirate Roberts&rdquo; (DPR) from the film &ldquo;The Princess Bride.&rdquo; Similarly to the movie script, DPR passed his name down to each successor and with the Silk Road, it&rsquo;s still unknown how many DPRs existed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Magical Tux, Rogue Agents, and How the Justice System Failed Miserably</h2>
<p>After detailing that there were other players who filled the DPR role, the recently published video also discussed how the former Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was a top suspect in the Silk Road case. Lots of the film&rsquo;s narration stems from public information sources and explains how Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan thought that Mark Karpeles was involved with the market operations.</p>
<figure id="attachment_350012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350012" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350012 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-300x100.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-768x256.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-696x232.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1392x464.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1068x356.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/geepers-1260x420.jpg 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350012" class="wp-caption-text">From left to right: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and his assistant Ashley Barr.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Der-Yeghiayan discovered a website on the clearnet called silkroadmarket.org that taught people how to use the market. According to Der-Yeghiayan&rsquo;s investigation, its URL was registered with XTA.net. Then subpoenas revealed that XTA.net was owned by Mark Karpeles&rsquo; firm Mutum Sigillum. Der-Yeghiayan stated that Karpeles operated &ldquo;hundreds of websites,&rdquo; which &ldquo;[made him] well-suited to operating a site such as the Silk Road.&rdquo; The HSI agent&rsquo;s reports also found that Karpeles used similar software to program his websites. In April 2012, Der-Yeghiayan believed that Karpeles and one of his associates, Ashley Barr, operated the Silk Road and controlled the DPR handle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_350014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350014" style="width: 546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-350014" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues.jpg" alt="" width="546" height="273" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rogues-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-350014" class="wp-caption-text">The two rogue agents: DEA agent Carl Mark Force (left) and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges (right).</figcaption></figure>
<p>The comprehensive film also explains how another federal agent took control of the Silk Road case and took all of Der-Yeghiayan&rsquo;s evidence. The video details how the same federal agent &ldquo;leaked investigation details to two Baltimore agents&rdquo; who eventually went rogue. DEA agent Carl Mark Force and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges were later found guilty for manipulating the case and stealing millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. The two-hour film contains a lot of information from the server takedown, the setup and arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the deletion of evidence during the investigation and how the entire case was an abomination of justice.

Despite previously rejecting it, the Canadian regulator finally accepted the fund&rsquo;s IPO prospectus after a public hearing and a favorable ruling.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Bitcoin Fund IPO</h2>
<p>Crypto-focused Canadian investment fund manager 3IQ Corp. announced on Thursday that it has filed a preliminary prospectus for the IPO of The Bitcoin Fund. More importantly, the prospectus dated Nov. 27 has been receipted by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) after previously rejecting it. The IPO will offer two classes of units at $10 each.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Fund is a closed-end investment fund established as a trust under Ontario&rsquo;s laws, the company explained, adding that &ldquo;the units will be an eligible qualified investment for registered investment accounts.&rdquo; The fund&rsquo;s investment objectives are to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation and exposure to bitcoin and its daily price movement in USD, the announcement details.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-349859 aligncenter" title="Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osc.png" alt="Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO" width="996" height="389" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osc.png 996w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osc-300x117.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osc-768x300.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osc-696x272.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px"></p>
<p>Founded in 2012, 3IQ already manages two other private digital asset funds for accredited investors in Canada. It will act as The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s investment and portfolio manager. The crypto-focused company has been working to bring a public bitcoin fund to market for Canadian retail investors since 2016.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Success After a Long Battle</h2>
<p>3IQ Corp. originally filed a preliminary prospectus for the IPO of The Bitcoin Fund with the OSC&rsquo;s Investment Funds & Structures Projects branch (IFSP) in October last year. However, the staff raised a number of concerns after reviewing it, arguing that the fund was not in the public interest of Canadians. This resulted in the IFSP director rejecting the fund&rsquo;s prospectus in February. The company then requested a hearing and a review of this decision. After a public hearing and several meetings, OSC Commissioner Lawrence P. Haber <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/osc-commissioner-debunks-arguments-against-bitcoin-green-lights-bitcoin-fund/">ruled</a> that the staff&rsquo;s concerns &ldquo;do not warrant denying a receipt for The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s prospectus.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-349860 aligncenter" title="Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada.jpg" alt="Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canada-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The commissioner believes that it is not the role of securities regulators to approve or disapprove of the merits of the underlying investment being offered to the public &mdash; bitcoin in this case. Among other bullish statements, he said, &ldquo;there is sufficient evidence of real volume and real trading in bitcoin on registered exchanges in large dollar size.&rdquo; After addressing each point of concern raised by the staff, the commissioner ordered the IFSP director to issue a receipt for the fund&rsquo;s prospectus unless new evidence was found to warrant a rejection. Several weeks later, the company announced that the regulator has finally issued a receipt for the fund&rsquo;s prospectus.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the staff noted that &ldquo;there are remaining steps for completion before a final offering prospectus can be receipted.&rdquo; Particularly, Commissioner Haber&rsquo;s order reveals that the final prospectus would include additional information regarding the offering such as pricing information and details regarding underwriters. The order further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>3IQ also confirmed that it does intend to offer units of the fund to Canadian retail investors in all provinces and territories of Canada.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company has clarified that the preliminary prospectus is subject to completion or amendment, and the sale will commence after the regulator has issued a receipt for the final prospectus.</p>

To many observers, the downtime has been very long after the rough crypto winter of 2018, but so far it&rsquo;s only been 711 days since the last price high.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Traders Patiently Wait for the Next Bull Run</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">Digital currency and BTC prices</a> rebounded after the fall in 2018 but not everyone is convinced the bearish sentiment is over. Optimism exists because on December 7 at approximately 8:05 EST, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices dropped to a low of $3,306 per coin but since then <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has regained at least half of the percentage losses. Positivity jumped back in the summer when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> rose 320% from the December 2018 low to a high of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20130428&end=20191130">$13,311</a> on June 27. But after that, expectations dropped when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices slid to the $7K region during the last week of October. The dip made people wonder if the crypto winter was still alive and well. However, on October 24 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices popped again from a low of $7,446 to a high of $10,021 on October 26. Since then <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices have been dragging low again and 27 days later the value dropped under $7K to a low of $6,400.</p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">gained 5-7%</a> in the last seven days and most digital asset markets seem to be in a recovery phase after the drops in value. One way to figure out how much longer it will be until the next ATH is by measuring how long it&rsquo;s been since the last <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price high. Historical data shows that between November 30, 2013 when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> surpassed $1,100 per coin it took <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-days-since-high/">1,170 days</a> to surpass the 2013 ATH on February 13, 2017. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kitconews/2013/12/10/2013-year-of-the-bitcoin/#6e9b9a94303c">Various factors</a> drove the price up in 2013 like Mt Gox bots, the Cyprus banking crisis, and Chinese demand. Similarly, feverish retail demand, excitement for regulated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> futures, economic hardships in Greece and Venezuela, South Korean demand, and the initial coin offering (ICO) boom helped fortify the 2017 ATH. When the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) initiated its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> futures markets and CME Group (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) followed with its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> derivatives products, spot markets were on fire. From February 13 to December 17, 2017, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> jumped 1,629% to its current ATH of $19,891 per coin.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">711 Days Since the December 17 All-Time High</h2>
<p>Another set of factors helped the price slide after touching near $20K per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Crypto enthusiasts witnessed the regulatory crackdown in South Korea, heightened regulatory guidelines in the U.S., EU and other regions worldwide, and the ICO market got slammed with regulations and criminal enforcement. Still, there are 459 days left if we look at the days between the 2013 ATH to when it touched again in 2017. So far there&rsquo;s only been <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-days-since-high/">711 days</a> between the ATH of $19,891 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Since the network launch on January 3, 2009 up until November 30, there&rsquo;s been approximately 3,983 days between.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-days-since-high/">Data also shows</a> that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has been on the up roughly 3,573 days of its existence which turns out to be 89% of its life cycle. During the downtimes, however, crypto enthusiasts grow very impatient and this is quite prevalent on social media and forums at the end of 2019. Investing in cryptos is really not good for health, years of bear markets followed by a few days of bull run hysteria &mdash; And FUD all along,&rdquo; one person <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPprophet/status/1197839221735731201">remarked</a> on Twitter this week. &ldquo;707 days of bear market &mdash; I think we need a break please,&rdquo; another crypto proponent <a href="https://twitter.com/akhillesart/status/1198487204290605056">said</a> on Sunday. On November 25 after <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices were drifting downward another trader on Twitter stated:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>In terms of [percentages], we&rsquo;re almost exactly where we were this many days after the bottom in 2014. The explosion out of the bear market was too quick and too irrational. This prolonged correction is normal. Markets never repeat, but they rhyme. This is just the 3rd verse.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The wait has been long and many people believe that being patient will reap the most rewards as the overall value of cryptocurrencies, in general, is headed northbound. As news.Bitcoin.com&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/author/grahamsmith/">Graham Smith</a> reported on November 24, data shows that despite the market turbulence, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-market-turbulence-bitcoins-support-lines-remain-intact/">BTC&rsquo;s support lines remain intact</a>. Just as no one was certain when the bear market would end after the 2013 ATH, this time around enthusiasts and traders are still guessing wildly. Analysts can log trendlines and trace historical patterns and we can measure days between ATHs as well, but we are mostly dependent on guesstimates and faith.</p>

Its price jumped well over 30% on Thursday, from $0.0310 per coin early on Nov. 28 to over $0.0450 a few hours later, and to a record high of 0.0473 on Friday, Nov. 29. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">SAI Maintains New Higher Price Range</h2>
<p>SAI is the native token of <a href="https://sideshift.ai/btc/bch">Sideshift AI</a>, an automated coin swapping platform that allows users to quickly exchange around two dozen cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), bitcoin core (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and several stablecoins. Of course, it supports SAI as well, which exists as a Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) token, an ERC-20 token and on the Liquid inter-exchange settlement network. It has a limited supply and only 210 million SAI will ever be minted.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-349872 size-full" title="Sideshift SLP Token SAI Gains Over 30% in Less Than 24 Hours" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sai-logo.jpg" alt="Sideshift SLP Token SAI Gains Over 30% in Less Than 24 Hours" width="533" height="277" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sai-logo.jpg 533w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sai-logo-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></p>
<p>The token is currently used to pay out rewards that can be earned by becoming a Sideshift <a href="https://sideshift.ai/affiliate">affiliate</a>. The exchange plans to increase its implementation in interactions with its services and other vendors. That includes rewards for takers of exchange orders, rebates when using SAI to pay fees, discounts for SAI merchant payments, paying employees, contractors, service providers, and partners in SAI. In the future, the crypto may be used to &ldquo;buy-and-burn&rdquo; Sideshift AI profits, offer trade incentives, and create merchant discounts, the platform&rsquo;s website details.</p>
<p>For the better part of the past 10 days, SAI&rsquo;s price stayed in the range between a low of $0.0272 and a high of $0.0346, data provided by markets.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/tokens/SAI">shows</a>. A significant upward movement began on Thursday, Nov. 28, when the price jumped from around $0.0308 to a record high of 0.0473 the following day, an increase of close to 35% for a little over 24 hours. Following a modest correction, the token is trading at around $0.0464 at the time of writing, preserving most of its price gains. Currently SAI has a market cap of over $568,000 and a 24-hour volume of $4.45 million.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Exchange Listings and SAI&rsquo;s Utility Increase Its Value</h2>
<p>SAI is currently trading at three cryptocurrency exchanges &ndash; <a href="https://sideshift.ai/btc/bch">Sideshift AI</a>, <a href="https://www.coinex.com/?refer_code=2a59x">Coinex</a>, and the <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com Exchange</a>. A major factor for the token&rsquo;s price increase may have been the recent announcement of its upcoming listing on a fourth platform. Last Sunday, Nov. 24, <a href="https://blog.cryptophyl.com">Cryptophyl</a> revealed it will be listing SAI in the first days of next month. The exchange also plans to airdrop 50,000 SAI tokens to holders of its own token, DROP. Users who have the coin in their wallets are eligible to receive token airdrops. The SAI-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> market will go live at 09:00 UTC, Dec. 3, the <a href="https://blog.cryptophyl.com/blog/announcing-sai-listing-and-airdrop/">announcement</a> detailed.</p>
<p>Andreas Brekken, the developer who launched Sideshift, told news.Bitcoin.com that the platform is excited to have its SAI token as one of the first SLP tokens listed on the Bitcoin.com Exchange. While price discovery is an efficient process, he noted, it can take time for market participants to research tokens and to have that reflected in the market. Commenting on SAI&rsquo;s recent price spike, he further elaborated:</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center">
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>The price increase of SAI is a result of buying pressure, likely from buyers having had time to research the utility of SAI and the promises of an automated coin swap service that doesn&rsquo;t require users to register an account to perform trades.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SLP tokens based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have been growing in number and approximately 5,000 have been created so far. They are issued by various projects and designed with a myriad of uses in mind. As news.Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/slp-token-ecosystem-built-on-bitcoin-cash-continues-to-blossom/">reported</a> in October, transactions using the SLP framework have increased significantly during the course of this year as well. The whole ecosystem has been expanding and besides many options to buy SLP tokens, you can also freely <a href="https://exchange.bitcoin.com/">trade</a> and safely <a href="https://badger.bitcoin.com">store</a> them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitcoin.com">Bitcoin.com</a> has been an active supporter of the adoption of the Simple Ledger Protocol, a system allowing anyone to create tokens based on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> network in a permissionless manner. One of the main reasons for the launch of Exchange.Bitcoin.com was to provide SLP projects with a platform to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/universal-protocol-alliance-to-list-mega-utility-token-on-bitcoin-com-exchange/">list</a> their various SLP tokens. An example of joint efforts in that direction is the integration of Sideshift, the issuer of the SAI token, with the <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com wallet</a>, which allows you to swap <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> within your mobile wallet app.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">US Attorney&rsquo;s Office Arrests Virgil Griffith for Teaching Blockchain Technology to North Koreans</h2>
<p>The U.S. Attorney SDNY and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-arrest-united-states-citizen-assisting-north-korea">announced</a> charges against <a href="https://twitter.com/virgilgr">Virgil Griffith</a> on November 29 detailing that the American citizen violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Griffith is a well known member of the cryptocurrency community and worked with the <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum Foundation</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-349822" title="Crypto Community Erupts Over Ethereum Foundation Member's Arrest" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393.jpg" alt="Crypto Community Erupts Over Ethereum Foundation Member's Arrest" width="523" height="209" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-300x120.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-768x307.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-696x278.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-1392x557.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-1068x427.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/202020200393-1050x420.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px"></p>
<p>U.S. law enforcement agencies allege that Griffith traveled to North Korea (DPRK) and gave &ldquo;a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.&rdquo; &ldquo;Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States&rsquo; foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,&rdquo; Assistant Attorney General John Demers said. &ldquo;By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ostensibly Griffith also traveled to the DPRK to present at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference despite the Department of State denying him permission to travel to DPRK. &ldquo;At no time did Griffith obtain permission from OFAC,&rdquo; the SDNY press release stressed. U.S. citizens and businesses are not permitted to transact with persons and companies on the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Pages/default.aspx">OFAC list</a>. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list is a record of individuals and companies that are tied to targeted or sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, Griffith and other attendees discussed how the DPRK could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions,&rdquo; the SDNY statement stressed. Griffith was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on November 28 and reportedly attended court the next day.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;A Government Corrupt at the Core&rsquo;</h2>
<p>After the cryptocurrency community caught wind of the news about Griffith&rsquo;s arrest many people were <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Virgil%20Griffith&src=typed_query">angered</a> at the U.S. government&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;Teaching about blockchain technology is illegal now in the Land of the Free,&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1200509621590315008">remarked</a> Shapeshift&rsquo;s CEO Erik Voorhees on Twitter. Some people mentioned how Griffith openly <a href="https://twitter.com/virgilgr/status/1161217917427470337">tweeted</a> about getting a Visa to DPRK and that the U.S. government took notice. &ldquo;Virgil&rsquo;s situation was avoidable to be sure &mdash; But this may be a sign of things to come,&rdquo; Coin Metric&rsquo;s founder Nic Carter <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1200542134232850465">opined</a>. &ldquo;Ultimately anyone writing code or creating resources for crypto can be alleged to be helping hostile jurisdictions avoid sanctions under this loose standard, whether or not they intend to,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>The notorious U.S. presidential candidate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-history-of-violent-intervention-john-mcafee-to-help-cuba-resist-us-sanctions-with-crypto/">John McAfee</a> said that the American government was dishonest. &ldquo;Virgil Griffith arrested for teaching North Korea how to avoid U.S. sanctions by using cryptocurrency and the Blockchain. See what our Government has become &mdash; A government corrupt at the core, declaring publicly available information a national secret,&rdquo; McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1200540436391251968">exclaimed</a>. Another person responded to McAfee&rsquo;s statement and <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielHarshman8/status/1200541272047374337">said</a>: &ldquo;Arrested for opposing the Wall Street/London Cartel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 36-year old Griffith is a resident of Singapore and citizen of the United States and his charges carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison if convicted. &ldquo;The charge in the Complaint is merely an accusation,&rdquo; explain the law enforcement agencies handling the case which include Counterintelligence, Export Control Section, and the Southern District&rsquo;s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Proponents Discuss Double Spends, Honoring the &lsquo;First Seen,&rsquo; and Current Zero-Confirmation Security</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) participants have always been intrigued by zero-confirmation transactions and concepts like double spend proofs that could strengthen instant transactions. Essentially a double spend is when someone tries to spend the same <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> to two different addresses. Even though it&rsquo;s not common, double spends on digital currencies like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a> can occur. The website <a href="https://doublespend.cash">doublespend.cash</a> tracks attempts and successful double spends on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. A Reddit user called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dagurval/">Dagurval</a>, a Bitcoin XT software developer and the creator of the data site, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/">explained</a> on Thursday that in order for double spends to succeed, they have to be sent simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only 1 out of 1,104 double spend attempts succeeded when broadcast more than 1 second later,&rdquo; the developer announced on Reddit. &ldquo;The chart &lsquo;Time between first seen and second seen&rsquo; shows the time difference between seeing the first transaction and the double spend,&rdquo; Dagurval told <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> supporters. The developer <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8yug52/">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>It demonstrates that in most cases, only when submitted simultaneously can a double spend succeed. It also shows that miners honor the &lsquo;first seen&rsquo; policy.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>After Dagurval posted the data, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> community discussed the risks of double spends and debated certain scenarios between a double spender and a merchant. &ldquo;Good to know, so it means 0-conf is quite safe and [double spend] proofs will make it safer,&rdquo; one user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8z0deg/">remarked</a>. Others were not so convinced and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8zu0so/">said</a> that &ldquo;unless you can measure how many of these are deliberate attempts of fraud, you can&rsquo;t somehow imply security from this figure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What [the data] means is that a merchant willing to wait three seconds to see if a duplicate transaction appears is roughly 99.9% safe in accepting an unconfirmed low-value transaction,&rdquo; Reddit user Jessquit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e2z0pf/only_1_out_of_1104_double_spend_attempts/f8zwoyl/">wrote</a> in response to the implication of security. The discussion was a popular debate on the subreddit r/btc, as the conversation would have likely been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brief-history-censorship-bitcoin/">censored</a> on the subreddit forum <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-mod-explains-r-bitcoin-censorship-and-why-he-was-removed/">r/bitcoin</a>. Dagurval&rsquo;s doublespend.cash statistics also had people discussing the idea of double spend proofs, a concept a few <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> developers have been experimenting with over the last few years.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Bitcoin Snack Machine and the Quest for Double Spend Proofs</h2>
<p>In July, news.Bitcoin.com reported on <a href="https://flowee.org/">Flowee the Hub</a> lead developer Tom Zander&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-bitcoin-cash-specs-propose-heightened-privacy-and-double-spend-proofs/">implementation</a> of a double spend proof-of-concept. The protocol documentation was also authored by the software developer <a href="https://twitter.com/im_uname">Imaginary Username</a> and programmer <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLundeberg">Mark Lundeberg </a>also contributed. BCHD and Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia wrote documentation for a system called the <a href="https://github.com/cpacia/spec/blob/master/double-spend-alerts.md">Double Spend Alert</a>. In 2015, former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn wrote about the subject in a <a href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/double-spending-in-bitcoin-be0f1d1e8008">paper</a> called &ldquo;Double spending in Bitcoin and how to make it harder.&rdquo; Hearn&rsquo;s research noted Gavin Andresen and Bitcoin XT developer Tom Harding&rsquo;s work on double spend relaying. Harding has researched the subject a great deal and he discussed a double spend relay detection system in his presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=OAt6B7b4GeM">Native Respend Resistance</a> at the 2018 Satoshi Vision Conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The quest for stopping even the 1 out of 1,105 successful double spends that are spent simultaneously has been something developers have strived for since Bitcoin was first created. Even Satoshi Nakamoto discussed the topic of zero-confirmation acceptance back in July 2010. In a well known bitcointalk.org thread called the &ldquo;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819">Bitcoin Snack Machine</a>,&rdquo; Satoshi said: &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;ll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.&rdquo; During the vending machine conversation, Satoshi also talked about honoring the &lsquo;first seen&rsquo; policy and a race between transactions sent fractions of a second ahead of each other.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-349777" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="600" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-300x120.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-768x307.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-696x278.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1392x557.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1068x427.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/satoshids-1050x420.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></p>
<p>&ldquo;The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they&rsquo;re trying to generate,&rdquo; Satoshi said at the time. &ldquo;When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it&rsquo;s a race to propagate to the most nodes first. If one has a slight head start, it&rsquo;ll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">German Banks Will Soon Be Able to Manage Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>According to the regional financial news publication Handelsblatt, in 2020 banking institutions from Germany will be able to manage <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">cryptocurrencies</a> for customers. Under newly enacted legislation, banks in Germany will be able to receive, store, and sell digital assets like bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>). Directive 2015/849 is an amended regulatory approach that was issued by the European Parliament and German politicians. The fourth EU money laundering directive highlights the fact that &ldquo;electronic money products is increasingly considered to be a substitute for bank accounts.&rdquo; Handelsblatt reporter Felix Holtermann reveals that the new directive&rsquo;s &ldquo;deletion of the so-called separation bid&rdquo; makes it so German banks can handle cryptocurrencies without needing to use a third-party custodian. Prior to erasing this part of the guidelines, the directive would have required banks to use &ldquo;external custodians or special subsidiaries&rdquo; to store the cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-349715 size-full" title="German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_183306242.jpg" alt="German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_183306242.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_183306242-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_183306242-768x432.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_183306242-696x392.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_183306242-746x420.jpg 746w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>In 2020, German banks will be able to offer cryptocurrency solutions alongside bonds, equities, and traditional stocks. The banks will need to procure a license to offer digital asset custodial services, but the directive extends application deadlines. The consulting firm <a href="https://distributed-ledger-consulting.de">DLC&rsquo;s</a> executive Sven Hildebrandt believes the initiative puts Germany ahead of the game. &ldquo;Germany is well on its way to becoming a crypto-heaven,&rdquo; Hildebrandt remarked. &ldquo;The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of cryptocurrencies.&rdquo; The cofounder of the crypto data aggregator website Coingecko, <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyong">Bobby Ong</a>, says that banks offering these types of services open financial institutions to a lot of opportunities. Ong <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyong/status/1200413251504205824">explained</a> on Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Just like how banks sell gold, stocks, unit trusts, and insurance directly to retail consumers now, I see no reason why banks will not offer cryptocurrencies for sale now. What&rsquo;s taking these bankers so long? It&rsquo;s a big gold mine waiting to be tapped.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">While Some Welcome the New Guidelines, Other Are More Critical of the Fourth EU Directive</h2>
<p>Local reports underline that the German banking association <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.bankenverband.de">Bundesverband deutscher Banken</a> </span>(BdB) &ldquo;welcomed the new regulation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Credit institutions are experienced in the safekeeping of client assets and in risk management, are committed to investor protection and have always been controlled by the financial supervision,&rdquo; the banking association said. BdB added that the new directive makes it possible for investors to invest in digital assets domestically rather than searching elsewhere for foreign funds. The CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1200375449622208514">emphasized</a> after the German bank crypto announcement that &ldquo;smart banks do this&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bitcoin [is] still not dead.&rdquo; Other critics don&rsquo;t find the fourth EU money laundering directive so inviting and friendly. &ldquo;With the new AML law, it affects the whole EU &mdash; combine this with negative interest rates for billions of euros which are sitting in their bank accounts &mdash; Next year everyone in the EU will get a bill for holding fiat in their bank accounts,&rdquo; a skeptic <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPrinter/status/1200378072954023938">wrote</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_349713" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-349713" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-349713 size-full" title="German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive.jpg" alt="German Banks Authorized to Store and Sell Cryptocurrency in 2020" width="1500" height="600" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-300x120.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-768x307.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-696x278.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1392x557.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1068x427.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/directive-1050x420.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-349713" class="wp-caption-text">The fourth EU money laundering directive.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another detractor against German banks holding <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">cryptocurrencies</a> is Baden-Wuerttemberg executive Niels Nauhauser. The financial analyst told the Handelsblatt that the new directives will add more strain to consumer protection advocates. &ldquo;If [German banks] are allowed to sell cryptocurrencies and keep them for a fee, they run the risk of turning their assets at risk of a total loss to their clients, without them knowing what they are getting into.&rdquo; Nauhauser also stressed that banks already have to inform customers about the costs and risks associated with investment vehicles like bonds and equities. The Baden-Wuerttemberg analyst underlined that direct sales of digital assets will need the same attention.</p>
