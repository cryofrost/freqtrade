<h2 style="text-align: center;">Anti-Blockchain Articles Censored</h2>
<p>Following President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-ranks-35-crypto-projects-as-president-xi-pushes-blockchain/">very bullish speech</a> on blockchain technology, news relating to blockchain has been extensively covered on national TV channels, newspapers and websites. &ldquo;Articles saying blockchain technology is a scam are now banned,&rdquo; popular Twitter user Cnledger <a href="https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/1188646805342322688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>, posting a screenshot of a message that says &ldquo;This content cannot be viewed due to violation,&rdquo; and that the platform is &ldquo;suspected of violating relevant laws, regulations, and policies.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Blockchain and Bitcoin Course Recommended</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Xuexi Qiangguo, a Chinese app primarily designed to teach Xi Jinping Thought, the political theory derived from Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, has recommended a course focusing on blockchain and <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/">bitcoin</a>. According to reports, Xuexi Qiangguo has more than 100 million active users as of October. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s most popular app, Xuexi Qiangguo (study for becoming powerful nation) now has a recommended course focusing entirely on blockchain, which contains Bitcoin & Ethereum lessons,&rdquo; Cnledger also wrote. &ldquo;The app [is] released by CPC [Communist Party of China] to help people learn about its political doctrines like Xi&rsquo;s thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The recommended course, entitled &ldquo;Introduction to Blockchain Technology,&rdquo; is taught by Chen Kang, an associate researcher at Tsinghua University&rsquo;s Blockchain Research Center. The course is also offered on Xuetangx, the first Chinese MOOC platform which was founded by the university. It has courses from over 500 universities and claims to have more than 16 million registered users. Chen&rsquo;s course covers an overview of blockchains, distributed consensus, Bitcoin, smart contracts, security, and big data.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Propaganda Tool With a Backdoor</h2>
<p>Designed by Alibaba Group and released by the CPC&rsquo;s publicity department in January, Xuexi Qiangguo is also the most downloaded app on Apple&rsquo;s domestic app store. This app mostly serves as a news aggregation platform for articles, short video clips and documentaries about President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s political philosophy.</p>
<p>While the Chinese government claims that the app is purely a fun educational tool, security researchers have discovered some code resembling a backdoor. An October report from U.S. government-backed Open Technology Fund (OTF), in collaboration with German cybersecurity firm Cure53, reveals that the Xuexi Qiangguo app has embedded code &ldquo;resembling a backdoor which is able to run arbitrary commands with superuser privileges.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344568 aligncenter" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/backdoor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/backdoor.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/backdoor-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/backdoor-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/backdoor-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/backdoor-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>If deployed, the code would grant a person complete system-wide administrative access, giving them &ldquo;the power to do anything,&rdquo; including downloading software, modifying files and data, or even installing a keylogger on the device. The app also scans for other apps installed on the device, the report notes, adding that the information collected by the app &mdash; such as user information, location, other apps on their phones, and activity log &mdash; is sent to various entities. Cure53 also conducted an audit of the app on Android operating systems, which make up more than 80% of smartphone operating systems in China. The firm found that the app gives the government the ability to determine &ldquo;the location of every citizen at any single point in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The State Council Information Office of China, responding to the Washington Post on behalf of the Chinese government, denied the app having the functions the reports suggest.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Legendary Lone Whale</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final draft of the research paper that&rsquo;s had Tether&rsquo;s lawyers seething for weeks has finally been published. Its conclusion &ndash; that a &lsquo;lone whale&rsquo; was single-handedly responsible for propelling bitcoin to $20k &ndash; has not changed, but the findings have been bolstered by the addition of peer review. Crypto commenters are not impressed, though, and have dismissed the paper as flawed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the updated paper from University of Texas Professor John Griffin and Ohio State University&rsquo;s Amin Shams, first published in 2018, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> buys on Bitfinex increased whenever bitcoin&rsquo;s value fell by certain increments. &ldquo;This pattern is only present in periods following printing of Tether, driven by a single large account holder, and not observed by other exchanges,&rdquo; concludes the latest iteration of the paper, due for publication in the Journal of Finance. It adds:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simulations show that these patterns are highly unlikely to be due to chance. This one large player or entity either exhibited clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large price impact on Bitcoin that is not observed in aggregate flows from other smaller traders.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tether&rsquo;s General Counsel Stuart Hoegner </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-04/lone-bitcoin-whale-likely-fueled-2017-price-surge-study-says?utm_source=twitter&utm_content=crypto&utm_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">countered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the paper was &ldquo;foundationally flawed&rdquo; and probably published to back a &ldquo;parasitic lawsuit.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;This is a transparent attempt to use the semblance of academia for a mercenary money grab.&rdquo;</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correlation Does Not Equal Causation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the cryptosphere, observers were almost unanimous in condemning the research paper. &ldquo;The venn diagram of people who don&rsquo;t believe in markets but rather see conspiracies and manipulation everywhere has a perfect overlap with people who are not active in those markets,&rdquo; tweeted Nic Carter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exclusively the purview of outsiders to claim the markets are somehow false. Umbrellas cause rain, finds Texas academic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circle CEO Jeremy Allair </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1191356754090745857"><span style="font-weight: 400;">labeled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the WSJ&rsquo;s story on the matter &ldquo;extremely weak reporting&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;in 2017/2018 there was demand for buying <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and a massive alt coin rally. The majority of that demand came from Asia and China, and since there were no CNY ramps into <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, everyone went to offshore <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> processors. These processors would then generate large prints of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>. The only thing this supposed analysis shows is that Asia traders demanded fiat to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://buy.bitcoin.com/btc" target="_blank">buy BTC</a>.&rdquo;</span></p>

The United Kingdom&rsquo;s tax authority clarifies its stance on cryptocurrencies and explains which taxes apply to specific activities carried out by business entities and private individuals. </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Also read: </em></strong><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bad-loans-at-big-british-banks-jump-over-50-in-a-year/"><strong><em>Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year</em></strong></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Taxable Activities Listed</h2>
<p>Multiple <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-tax-tools-to-help-crypto-owners/">tax tools</a> now exist to help crypto users and businesses from the industry with tax reporting. But in a field as fluid as the crypto space, regulations change rapidly. On Nov. 1, HMRC published updated policy papers concerning crypto transactions undertaken by companies, other businesses such as sole traders and partnerships, and individuals.</p>
<p>The agency notes that the documents deal with the tax treatment of &ldquo;exchange tokens,&rdquo; explicitly mentioning bitcoin. They do not apply to tokens issued in initial coin offerings (ICOs). The taxation of security and utility tokens will be addressed separately in the future. Taking into account the specifics of the fast-changing industry, HMRC says it will look at each case and apply the relevant provisions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344474 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1197742753.jpg" alt="Britain&rsquo;s Tax Authority Updates Crypto Guidelines" width="1000" height="507" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1197742753.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1197742753-300x152.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1197742753-768x389.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1197742753-696x353.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1197742753-828x420.jpg 828w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The tax office has listed a number of crypto-related activities that give rise to tax obligations. These include buying, selling and exchanging tokens for other assets, including cryptocurrencies. Crypto mining has been mentioned as a taxable economic activity. Businesses providing goods or services in return for digital coins also owe taxes to the British government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets">guidelines</a> review the applicable taxes as well and corporate entities conducting any of the aforementioned activities are likely to be liable to pay one or more of the following taxes: capital gains tax, corporation tax, income tax, value added tax (VAT), and stamp taxes. National Insurance contributions are also due.</p>
<p>Private individuals will be liable to pay capital gains tax when they sell crypto assets that have been acquired as a personal investment, or income tax and National Insurance contributions on coins they receive from employers, mining or airdrops. Traders may reduce their income tax liability by offsetting losses against future profits. The amount paid for an asset is considered a cost that can be allowed as a deduction. The loss of a private key, however, does not count as a disposal of the assets for capital gains tax purposes. Victims of theft cannot claim a loss either.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cryptocurrency Not Money</h2>
<p>HMRC addresses other important aspects of taxation concerning crypto-related transactions. The authority emphasizes that taxable profits, and losses respectively, should be calculated and reported in British pounds on tax returns filed by companies and individuals. In case a transaction does not involve GBP, an &ldquo;appropriate exchange rate&rdquo; must be established in order to convert the transaction to fiat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344478 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1165643155.jpg" alt="Britain&rsquo;s Tax Authority Updates Crypto Guidelines" width="1000" height="517" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1165643155.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1165643155-300x155.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1165643155-768x397.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1165643155-696x360.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1165643155-812x420.jpg 812w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The agency does not explain clearly what it would consider an &lsquo;appropriate&rsquo; valuation but stresses that a &ldquo;consistent methodology&rdquo; should be used. The papers further emphasize that profits from a crypto trade must be calculated in accordance with either the U.K. generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP) or in accordance with international accounting standards (IAS).</p>
<p>The requirement to keep records in fiat equivalent has to do with the tax department&rsquo;s current stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies. &ldquo;It is important to note that HMRC does not consider any of the current types of cryptoassets to be money or currency. This means that any Corporation Tax legislation which relates solely to money or currency does not apply to exchange tokens or other types of cryptoasset,&rdquo; the administration points out.</p>
<p>However, the tax regulator remarks that &ldquo;if an employer &lsquo;pays&rsquo; exchange tokens as earnings to an employee, those exchange tokens count as &lsquo;money&rsquo;s worth&rsquo;.&rdquo; In other words, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-eu-and-uk-companies-can-now-pay-workers-in-bitcoin-cash-via-bitwage/">crypto salaries</a> paid in the United Kingdom are subject to income tax and National Insurance contributions on the fiat value of the cryptocurrency used for remuneration.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;The Future of Digital Money Being Shaped by National Governments&rsquo; Is a Lie</h2>
<p>It sure seems like 2015 again, as the mainstream media continues to promote blockchain technology that&rsquo;s backed by large corporations and governments. Well before digital currency projects like Facebook&rsquo;s Libra and Telegram&rsquo;s Gram have even launched, corporate media outlets claim these projects will annihilate assets like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>. It seems people who believe this absurdity think that just because a blockchain project is backed by Facebook, has a development team and produced a whitepaper it will be better than a network that&rsquo;s been running for more than a decade. Commentators and columnists include Bloomberg&rsquo;s Lionel Laurent who recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-04/bitcoin-s-government-enemies-will-have-their-sweet-revenge">wrote</a> that &ldquo;the future of digital money is being shaped increasingly by national governments.&rdquo; However, this is not even close to being a reality as a great majority of governments and central banks still don&rsquo;t understand the technology to this day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344450" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344450" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/telegram-and-facebook-784x441.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="264" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/telegram-and-facebook-784x441.jpg 784w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/telegram-and-facebook-784x441-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/telegram-and-facebook-784x441-768x432.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/telegram-and-facebook-784x441-696x392.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/telegram-and-facebook-784x441-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344450" class="wp-caption-text">Telegram and Facebook have yet to prove anything with the blockchain projects they are working on, yet mainstream media says these protocols will destroy legacy cryptos.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few governments and central banks that have said publicly that they plan to experiment with a digital currency that represents legal tender. But there&rsquo;s really only one nation-state so far that has completed this mission and Venezuela&rsquo;s petro is more like an awful joke. Despite what Sunacrip (the Venezuelan entity in charge of cryptos) says, the petro is not accepted widely across the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody uses the petro and only people close with government use it to skip out on U.S. sanctions,&rdquo; a student from Bogata, Colombia <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/distrust-of-the-bolivar-prompts-venezuelans-to-seek-sound-money/">told</a> news.Bitcoin.com in September. &ldquo;Sunacrip is really only for miners &mdash; they have installed crypto point-of-sale (POS) systems around some stores, but the POS only accepts bitcoin, litecoin, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, so if you have petros, you need to exchange that.&rdquo; The Venezuelan petro is no better than the Onecoin scam, but promoted by a socialist government.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Projects Like China&rsquo;s Digital Yuan, Libra, R3, and Hyperledger Have Produced Nothing</h2>
<p>Mainstream media has made it seem like state-issued currencies that are not even here yet will dominate legacy cryptos almost immediately. Bloomberg&rsquo;s Lionel Laurent assumes that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/have-you-tried-blockchain-5-0-yet-nobody-else-has-either/">vaporware</a> (a heavily advertised concept that has yet to work) like a digital yuan and Google&rsquo;s quantum computer are threats to existing cryptocurrencies. Again both concepts have not been seen in the real world and it&rsquo;s akin to saying a newborn baby could pummel a 10-year-old in a boxing match.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344455" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344455" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344455 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1a_ufb24p_n-ybgusg1mwbw.jpeg" alt="" width="692" height="360" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1a_ufb24p_n-ybgusg1mwbw.jpeg 692w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1a_ufb24p_n-ybgusg1mwbw-300x156.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344455" class="wp-caption-text">China&rsquo;s censored internet and the communist government thinks a digital yuan will outpace public, uncensored blockchains.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The slew of blockchain ideas from governments, major banks, and corporations such as R3 and Hyperledger have not produced any real-world value. These projects don&rsquo;t stand on enough credibility to deserve mass mainstream headlines but they are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-world-banks-blockchain-bond-is-just-a-fancy-way-of-selling-debt/">promoted</a> by the old guard regularly. They want people to believe that nothingness, vaporware, and whitepaper promises will surpass legacy digital currencies that exist in the wild today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344442" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344442 size-full" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blockchainlinament.png" alt="" width="700" height="445" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blockchainlinament.png 700w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blockchainlinament-300x191.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blockchainlinament-696x442.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blockchainlinament-661x420.png 661w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344442" class="wp-caption-text">If you are looking at blockchain as the cure, y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou are looking in the wrong place. </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Blockchain projects promoted by banks, corporations, and politicians are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-legitimate-cure-money-system/">snake oil</a>. They do not cure the financial ailments global citizens are dealing with because they are meant to manipulate the public even more. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/money-and-democracy-how-the-elite-manipulated-ledgers-and-created-a-social-ranking-system/">For hundreds of years</a>, the same bankers and the same families have controlled the world&rsquo;s finances and resources. The reason cryptocurrencies matured a great deal faster than most financial concepts is because they remove the need to depend on the state and central banks. There is no blockchain project produced by a corporation or the old guard that even comes close to being a speck on the current cryptoconomy&rsquo;s radar. These blockchains really resemble the antiquated databases used today with a few fancy bells and whistles like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-finds-certain-proof-of-stake-networks-vulnerable-to-low-cost-attacks/">proof-of-stake</a>, timestamps, and hashing.</p>
<p>The question remains: When will media pundits give up on lauding vaporware and things that don&rsquo;t even exist yet? Central banks and governments want you to believe the FUD is so bad that only central planners can succeed. Right now, at least for the time being, the propaganda they spread couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">DX Exchange Is Looking for a Buyer</h2>
<p>Estonia-based digital assets trading venue DX Exchange has announced that as of Sunday, November 3, the platform is not allowing any more deposits from clients, trading is suspended and all open orders have been canceled. This is done to close the exchange until a new buyer can be found for the company. Alternatively, DX may merge with another exchange to reduce the high cost of running the business. The company also reassured clients that all their funds are safe and need to be returned to allow a merger or a sale to proceed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344363" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-344363" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-1024x512.jpg" alt="Crypto Winter Claims Another Victim as DX Exchange Closes" width="696" height="348" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-1392x696.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia-840x420.jpg 840w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/estonia.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344363" class="wp-caption-text">Tallinn, Estonia</figcaption></figure>
<p>&ldquo;We must inform the community that the board of directors of DX.Exchange has decided to temporarily close the exchange as we pursue a merger or outright sell of the company,&rdquo; the team wrote in a blog <a href="https://blog.dx.exchange/2019/11/03/6595/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. &ldquo;The cost of providing the required level of security, support and technology is not economically feasible on our own. The board believes this is the best opportunity for DX.Exchange to achieve success for its shareholders and compete in this challenging market. In the event a merger or sell is not completed in a timely manner then the exchange may not resume operations and take appropriate action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smaller crypto exchanges find it difficult to survive in the current market as they have to spend a lot of money to comply with new regulations and compete with giants such as Binance. However, many other types of ventures in the digital assets industry are suffering too. Just recently we <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-name-announcements-will-not-save-your-blockchain-project/">reported</a> that Platin, a secure Proof of Location protocol which incentivizes nodes at scale by means of its own blockchain-based token, shut down on Nov. 1, 2019, despite all the recognition it got over the last two years.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tokenized Stocks, ETFs and Crypto</h2>
<p>DX Exchange was only <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/european-exchange-to-offer-investing-in-stocks-with-cryptocurrencies/">launched</a> on Jan. 7, 2019. It accepted deposits in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, and a few other cryptocurrencies as well as traditional fiat payment options. It initially offered trading on the tokenized stocks of some of the biggest public companies in the world, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. This had been achieved through an agreement with MPS Marketplace Securities Ltd., which issued tokens that represent stocks via smart contracts and held the real world stocks according to demand on the platform.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;digital stocks&rdquo; were said to be backed 1:1 with the real-world stocks traded on conventional stock exchanges, like stablecoins backed by equities rather than fiat. Unlike traditional stock exchanges, this arrangement allowed the platform to offer its users the ability to trade on stocks 24/7.</p>

<p>DX Exchange holds operating licenses from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit and reportedly employed over 70 developers in an R&D center in Israel. It is backed by NFX, a seed and series A focused venture capital firm based in San Francisco. The regulated platform operated in full compliance with Mifid II (the latest EU financial regulations), which means it featured a robust AML/KYC process. Its partner, MPS Marketplace Securities Ltd. is a Cyprus-licensed financial company which provides liquidity solutions for the online trading market.</p>
<p>The technology powering DX Exchange is built on Nasdaq&rsquo;s Financial Information exchange (FIX), a vendor-neutral standard message protocol that defines an electronic message exchange for communicating securities transactions between two parties. The platform also supported trading via an API, which means it can be easily integrated with market makers, liquidity providers, algo traders, and hedge funds.</p>
<p>In early March, it was reported that DX Exchange began offering trading on tokenized exchange-traded funds (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/in-the-daily-tokenized-etfs-chainalysis-binance-labs-in-argentina/">ETFs</a>), including Nasdaq-mirrored QQQ, S&Ps and SPY. Later that month, it was also revealed that the platform was starting to list security token offerings (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/daily-stos-crypto-tax-coinbase/">STOs</a>).</p>
<p>Any security token could submit an application to be listed and needed to meet eligibility requirements for listing on the exchange. The potential issuers were evaluated according to their achievements, transparency, fundraising method, and management team. DX also required a legal opinion which supports the STO&rsquo;s legitimacy and performed background checks on the management team and directors. For each security token which was offered, a whitepaper explaining the conditions, economic benefits and risks was required.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Largest Lenders Write Off More Debt Than a Year Ago</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s largest lenders have been writing off more loans than they were last year, another indication that many businesses are hurting in a deteriorating economic environment. In Q3 of 2019, writedowns on bad debt at four major British banks increased 51% from the same quarter of 2018, the Daily Mail reported quoting corporate figures.</p>
<p>The amount of nonperforming loans that have been written off by RBS, Lloyds, HSBC, and Barclays between July and September reached &pound;1.76 billion (approx. $2.27 billion). During the same period last year it was around &pound;1.17 billion ($1.51 billion), an analysis conducted by U.K.-based financial services company AJ Bell shows.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344381 size-full" title="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849.jpg" alt="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" width="1000" height="506" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-300x152.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-768x389.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-696x352.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1154200849-830x420.jpg 830w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The difference of almost &pound;600 billion has been attributed to the worsening economic conditions that are negatively affecting more and more companies operating in the country. One such example is the British global travel group Thomas Cook which collapsed in September.</p>
<p>A total of 4,355 businesses were unable to pay their debts in the third quarter, according to official data from the U.K. government&rsquo;s Insolvency Service. That&rsquo;s the highest number in five years recorded by the London-headquartered executive agency of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Low Interest Rates to Further Squeeze Bank Revenues</h2>
<p>Bad loans are not the only challenge the United Kingdom&rsquo;s top lenders are currently facing. According to the publication, the banks have also warned they expect their revenues to be negatively affected by the low mortgage rates which are nearing their record lows at the moment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_344383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344383" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-344383 size-full" title="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista.jpg" alt="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" width="730" height="490" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista.jpg 730w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-300x201.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-696x467.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-626x420.jpg 626w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-190x128.jpg 190w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mortgage-rates-statista-380x256.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344383" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/386301/uk-average-mortgage-interest-rates/">study</a> published by market data provider Statista, interest rates on mortgages in Britain have been continuously declining for the past five years. In June 2019, two-year fixed rate mortgages were at 1.65%, down from 2.60% in the summer of 2014. The two-year variable interest rate has dropped from 2.71% to 1.99. The 10-year fixed rate has decreased from 4.06% in September 2014 to 2.63% this past June.</p>
<p>Credit institutions can hardly raise rates on mortgages right now as the base interest rate set by the Bank of England is only 0.75%. It has remained below 1% ever since the central bank&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee cut it in 2009 to 0.5% where it stayed for around seven years. The average variable mortgage rate at the time was 2.5%. The rate was dropped to its lowest ever mark of 0.25% in August 2016.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344386 size-full" title="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_154264334.jpg" alt="Bad Loans at Big British Banks Jump Over 50% in a Year" width="999" height="506" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_154264334.jpg 999w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_154264334-300x152.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_154264334-768x389.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_154264334-696x353.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_154264334-829x420.jpg 829w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></p>
<p>Although the cost of borrowing was raised in August 2018 to 0.75%, its highest level since early 2009, serious concerns remain regarding the state of the British economy and its perspectives. After another unsuccessful attempt to leave the European Union, the U.K. is now heading towards its third general election in five years, which is creating more uncertainty for its economy already weakened by the global economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, things have been developing differently in the nascent crypto banking sector where loans backed with digital assets and cryptocurrency deposits are enjoying <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/earn-more-interest-on-your-crypto-with-these-comparison-tools/">growing popularity</a>. Platforms such as <a href="https://mycred.io/">Cred</a> offer clients an opportunity to <a href="https://earn.mycred.io/bitcoin">earn</a> up to 10% interest on their holdings in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and <a href="https://mycred.io/borrow/">borrow</a> using their crypto as collateral. Cred also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cred-merchant-solutions-to-help-unbanked-business-sectors/">provides solutions</a> to unbanked business sectors.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Re-Gadgetification of Things</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">80s kids mourning the loss of the gadget-based society they were raised in are naturally drawn to crypto cold storage. For every device (portable radio; spirit level; tape measure) that was subsumed into the iPhone, there&rsquo;s another that hardware wallet (HW) manufacturers have seen fit to develop and isolate from the smartphone in the name of opsec.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a logic in wanting to keep your hot assets &ndash; i.e anything connected to the web &ndash; separate from your cold &ndash; typically those you cherish the most and have no intention of liquidating in a hurry. That said, it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to tell how much of these aftermarket HW accessories are actually helping, and how much of it is just cold storage theater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That there are benefits to keeping your <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/">crypto assets</a> safely stashed where hackers, phishers, and SIM-swappers can&rsquo;t operate is clear. What&rsquo;s less evident is whether entombing your hardware wallet in a hermetically sealed vault kept at absolute zero with a pack of rottweilers guarding it and anti-tank guns watching the skies is absolutely necessary. Until we see empirical studies on the success rates of extreme opsec compared with, say, scrawling your seed phrase on a scrap of paper and stashing it in a drawer, it&rsquo;s really hard to say.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mother of All Backups</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivered in a smart tray that evokes a luxury chocolate box, the Cryptosteel is described as &ldquo;the mother of all backups.&rdquo; Not the daddy, not the son, and certainly not the creepy half-cousin: the &lsquo;steel is all momma. The device, </span><a href="https://cryptosteel.com/product/cryptosteel-capsule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available singly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or in packs of up to five, is described as being &ldquo;compatible with most secret sharing and key generation algorithms.&rdquo; By that, its manufacturers mean there&rsquo;s enough numbers and letters in the box to cover most 12-word seed permutations. You can cram 123 characters onto the stick before it&rsquo;s maxed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the stick isn&rsquo;t quite accommodating enough for a 24-word seed: in testing, I managed 21 words before running out of space. Given that the capsules retail for $100, it seems a little excessive to require multiple capsules to store a single seed. That said, 12 words should suffice for most wallet seeds, and you might even fit on 24 words if they happen to be short and you remove the word separators that are meant to be inserted.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_344329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344329" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-344329" title="Cryptosteel Capsule Will Keep Your Wallet Seed Safe and Out of Sight" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-1024x768.jpg" alt="Cryptosteel Capsule Will Keep Your Wallet Seed Safe and Out of Sight" width="696" height="522" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-300x225.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-80x60.jpg 80w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-160x120.jpg 160w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-696x522.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel-560x420.jpg 560w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/steel.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-344329" class="wp-caption-text">My capsule with 21 of 24 seed words squeezed on.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Than a Steel Punch in the Face</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like the <a href="https://cryptosteel.com/product/cryptosteel-capsule/">Cryptosteel Capsule</a>, despite its limitations. It&rsquo;s not as alpha as using a steel punch, but it&rsquo;s a lot easier to create your wallet seed with, and feels almost as permanent. Just be careful when the time comes to unthread it, as one slip and your painstakingly assembled seed will be alphabet soup. It&rsquo;s hard to say whether sitting in bed threading steel beads onto a metal stick is the financial sovereignty Satoshi dreamed of, or simply a regression to making macaroni art in kindergarten, but it sure is fun. More importantly, it&rsquo;s a secure way of recording your seed provided you can keep the innocuous looking capsule in a safe place away from prying eyes.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Director&rsquo;s Refusal Axed, Fund Green-Lighted</h2>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published a document Wednesday detailing Commissioner Lawrence P. Haber&rsquo;s reasons to overturn the commission&rsquo;s previous decision regarding 3IQ Corp and The Bitcoin Fund. A preliminary prospectus for the public offering of this fund was filed with the OSC&rsquo;s Investment Funds & Structured Products branch (IFSP) in October last year. However, in February, the IFSP refused to issue a receipt of The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s prospectus after its staff raised a number of concerns.</p>
<p>3IQ Corp and The Bitcoin Fund subsequently applied for a hearing and a review of this decision. After multiple hearings, Commissioner Haber ruled on Tuesday that the staff&rsquo;s concerns &ldquo;do not warrant denying a receipt for The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s prospectus&rdquo; and ordered the IFSP director&rsquo;s decision to be set aside and a receipt for a final prospectus of The Bitcoin Fund issued. Unless the staff can find new grounds for refusal, the final prospectus can be used to offer securities to the public.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344101 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="482" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-300x145.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-768x370.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-696x335.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/osc-871x420.jpg 871w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Canadian investment fund manager 3IQ Corp. confirmed Wednesday that &ldquo;it has received a favorable ruling&rdquo; from its public hearing before an OSC panel regarding The Bitcoin Fund. The fund will be a public, non-redeemable investment fund that will invest all of its assets in bitcoin. 3IQ, which also manages a private crypto investment fund, will be The Bitcoin Fund&rsquo;s investment and portfolio manager.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not Our Job to Decide the Merits of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In the document, Commissioner Haber addressed every concern raised by the IFSP staff. He began by stating that this case &ldquo;is not about the merits of bitcoin as an investment&rdquo; because &ldquo;It is not the role of securities regulators to approve or disapprove of the merits of securities being offered to the public.&rdquo; He pointed out that all prospectuses filed in Canada even say on the cover page that &ldquo;No securities regulatory authority has expressed an opinion about these securities and it is an offence to claim otherwise.&rdquo; The commissioner remarked:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is also outside the scope of the authority of securities regulators to immunize investors against risk or against loss. And, it is not the job of securities regulators to ban speculation or risk-taking.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344104 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/picking-winners-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The document further explains that while bitcoin is &ldquo;a novel asset in an emerging and evolving market,&rdquo; it can later mature and change significantly, adding that although some assets in this class fail and become tulip bulbs, others can become gold and the next generation of technology. &ldquo;Securities regulators are not mandated to try to pick winners and losers,&rdquo; the document details.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitcoin Is Not Illiquid</h2>
<p>As a key reason for rejection, the IFSP staff submits that &ldquo;Bitcoin is an illiquid asset &hellip; Therefore, by holding bitcoin, the fund would not comply with the restriction against holding illiquid assets set out in section 2.4 of NI 81-102.&rdquo; Commissioner Haber disagreed. He said: &ldquo;I do not agree with Staff&rsquo;s submission &hellip; I find that Staff has not shown that bitcoin is an illiquid asset, as defined in NI 81-102,&rdquo; emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I find that there is sufficient evidence of real volume and real trading in bitcoin on registered exchanges in large dollar size, both in absolute terms and compared to other markets for commodities and equities, which constitutes a liquid market.</p></blockquote>
<p>The commissioner referenced some existing investment products providing exposure to bitcoin such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which is available to Canadians.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Price Manipulation</h2>
<p>The IFSP staff also decided that it is not in the public interest to issue a receipt for the fund&rsquo;s prospectus due to concerns about its &ldquo;ability to value its assets for investors given the significant market integrity concerns regarding the trading of bitcoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;the security and safekeeping of the fund&rsquo;s bitcoin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fund&rsquo;s ability to file audited financial statements, as required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding price manipulation associated with crypto assets, Haber concluded that the staff &ldquo;has not established that the fund will be unable to arrive at a net asset value that satisfies the requirements of NI 81-106.&rdquo; While acknowledging the existence of fake volumes and unregistered market trading, the commissioner said the &ldquo;Staff has not proven that true price discovery in the bitcoin market is prevented by insufficient &lsquo;true trading&rsquo; or price manipulation, at least on the regulated exchanges.&rdquo; He added that the evidence presented to him suggests that wash trading and fake volume are used primarily to attract more traders and issuers, and &ldquo;did not establish systemic and sustained manipulation of the price of bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344105 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bitcoin-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The commissioner also placed weights on the steps taken by the company to mitigate the risks of manipulation such as its selection of MVIBTC as the index and the fund&rsquo;s non-redeemable structure. He also noted that other bitcoin holdings, such as GBTC, have been successfully valued, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is worth noting that bitcoin is a commodity, not an equity or other security &hellip; The risk of market manipulation exists in all commodity markets. Many of Staff&rsquo;s stated concerns could apply equally to other commodities, such as precious metals or foreign currencies. Staff did not persuade me that bitcoin is more susceptible to manipulation than other commodity products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding custodian and security risk, the commissioner said, &ldquo;Like any valuable commodity, I accept that bitcoin can be stolen or lost.&rdquo; He conveyed that the staff did not establish that the fund&rsquo;s custodians do not follow sufficient practices for safeguarding bitcoin. Commenting on New York-based Gemini Trust Company which will act as a custodian of the fund&rsquo;s bitcoin, Haber opined, &ldquo;I am not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence that professional, regulated crypto-asset custodians, like Gemini, have suffered losses of customer assets.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Staff&rsquo;s Lack of Authority</h2>
<p>Commissioner Haber also disagreed with the staff&rsquo;s submission that investor protection extends to the assets the fund proposes to hold or the markets in which they trade. He explained that if the staff&rsquo;s analysis were to apply to The Bitcoin Fund, then &ldquo;it would amount to a ban on any funds holding bitcoin, regardless of their structure or management.&rdquo; Furthermore, he pointed out that &ldquo;the length of Staff&rsquo;s proposed ban would be uncertain,&rdquo; emphasizing that the ban would effectively remain in place until the staff&rsquo;s concerns have diminished, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Staff has not provided any authority for imposing such an indeterminate ban.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344109 aligncenter" title="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1.jpg" alt="Ontario Securities Commissioner Clears Concerns Over The Bitcoin Fund" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/flags1-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Investor Protection</h2>
<p>Since investors have other means of acquiring bitcoin, the commissioner questioned how the staff&rsquo;s proposed ban would protect them from &ldquo;unfair, improper or fraudulent practices.&rdquo; On the contrary, he expects it will ensure that investors could not invest in bitcoin through a public fund, reiterating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Denying investors the opportunity to invest in bitcoin through a public fund would not promote fair and efficient capital markets and confidence in capital markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, it would suggest that investors should acquire bitcoin through unregulated vehicles, and capital market participants should be encouraged to create those vehicles,&rdquo; the commissioner opined. He believes that &ldquo;The issuance of a receipt for the final prospectus of the fund would promote efficient capital markets by creating an alternative to GBTC,&rdquo; which he noted is available to Canadian retail investors but trades at a significant premium to its net asset value. It would also &ldquo;promote efficient capital markets by giving retail investors a means of diversifying their investment portfolios through access to an additional uncorrelated asset class,&rdquo; the commissioner concluded.</p>

Wright looked as though it was coming to an end as the two parties reached a non-binding settlement. Then on October 30, without much notice, Wright explained that he couldn&rsquo;t finance the settlement and the agreement was broken. Now the trial will start again and the Kleiman estate hopes to depose Wright&rsquo;s former chief financial officer, James Wilson on November 8.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wright Breaks the Non-Binding Settlement as the Billion Dollar Bitcoin Lawsuit Continues</h2>
<p>Australian native Craig Wright, the man who claims to be Bitcoin&rsquo;s inventor, will be seeing more court proceedings in the near future as the notorious Kleiman v. Wright case is back on. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/kleiman-v-wright/">Craig Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman</a>, the brother of the now-deceased David Kleiman, for allegedly interfering with David&rsquo;s bitcoin assets and intellectual property after he died. Last September, news.Bitcoin.com reported on how the two parties were seemingly headed toward a settlement as both legal teams came to a non-binding settlement. This happened after the judge ruled the Kleimans were to be awarded 50% of Wright&rsquo;s alleged <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings and 50% of his blockchain intellectual property (IP). However, the Kleiman estate has filed a new <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.290.0.pdf">court document</a> which details that &ldquo;Craig could no longer finance the settlement and was &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; the non-binding settlement agreement.&rdquo; So Roche Freedman LLP wrote in the filing that after a lot of &ldquo;lost time&rdquo; the team will be &ldquo;shifting back into preparing for trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-344269" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="400" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s.jpg 880w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s-300x136.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s-768x349.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cimmys333s-696x316.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"></p>
<p>Following the broken settlement, the law firm explained it was in contact with James Wilson, the chief financial officer (CFO) of Craig&rsquo;s companies in 2012-2013. This period of time is when Dave Kleiman was still alive and Wright alleged that he sold Dave interest in his businesses in exchange for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Although Wright&rsquo;s legal team, Rivero Mestre LLP, came back five hours after the Kleiman estate requested permission to depose Wilson and informed the plaintiffs they would not consent to the deposition on November 8. Wright&rsquo;s council said the team would need to consent to a video deposition at a later date.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Due to the unexpected failure of settlement negotiations, and the soon approaching discovery cutoff, the parties are short on time,&rdquo; Roche Freedman&rsquo;s filing notes. &ldquo;Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s presence in the United States next week obviates the need for the parties to go through the legal, logistical, and expensive steps of securing a deposition in Australia. And while Craig won&rsquo;t have been afforded a full 14-days notice, he has received 7-days notice.&rdquo; The Kleiman estate&rsquo;s court filing adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Importantly the fact that Craig doesn&rsquo;t have 14-days notice of this deposition is a product of his own conduct. He asked the parties to pause the litigation process and concentrate on amicably resolving this dispute, only to pull his consent with no advance notice, without good cause, and at a time when it simply wasn&rsquo;t possible to give him the full 14-days notice.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">James Wilson and Cryptoloc Technology</h2>
<p>According to the Twitter handle &lsquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy007forsure/status/1190940848034201601">Seeking Satoshi</a>,&rsquo; James Wilson is a former business associate of Wright&rsquo;s and co-patent holder. &ldquo;So the court in Florida would like to have a chat with Jamie Wilson, one time CFO for one of Craig&rsquo;s dodgy companies and co-patent holder for Cryptoloc. But what does the court want from Jamie?&rdquo; Seeking Satoshi asked on Twitter. &ldquo;Do they think Jamie can shed some light on Craig&rsquo;s financial dealings with Dave? Or do they suspect that Dave was involved in the development of Jamie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cryptoloc&rsquo; and may be owed some money for his hand in the IP behind it?&rdquo; The researcher continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>I doubt the court will uncover much from speaking with Jamie and I don&rsquo;t think any IP, bitcoin or money will be found that belongs to Dave. At some point, the court will realise there is no Tulip trust and no bitcoin and that Craig has led everyone on a goose chase.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Wilson is also mentioned in a <a href="https://medium.com/@craig_10243/from-the-bygone-days-of-yore-part-1-632efa716024">blog post</a> called &ldquo;From the Bygone Days of Yore &mdash; Part 1,&rdquo; written by Wright in June. Wright stated at the time that he had video link meetings with &ldquo;Jamie Wilson, Robert Urquhart, and Dave Kleiman&rdquo; with lawyers present in 2012. Roche Freedman&rsquo;s motion requests that the court allows them to depose Wilson on November 8 with the defense team present via video-link. According to the court documents, a trial is scheduled to start on March 30, 2020, depending on the proceedings.</p>
