An email newsletter concerning forthcoming updates to Bitmex indices CC&rsquo;d a large proportion of the company&rsquo;s mailing list, exposing the addresses of its users to the public. In a second embarrassment, Bitmex had its Twitter account hacked shortly afterward.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitmex Suffers a Day of Reckoning</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s been a rough 24 hours for derivatives exchanges. Shortly before Bitmex CC&rsquo;d in its mailing list, Deribit was forced to reimburse traders who were liquidated due to an error in its price index. Bitmex users are now being urged to change their details, with hackers and phishers certain to try and crack the leaked email addresses, many of which are likely to be tied to accounts on different crypto exchanges. The leaked and then aggregated Bitmex database is now up for sale on the darknet.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deribit will reimburse over $1.3 million in losses from the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> index calculation data issue around 21:00:00 UTC on October 31, 2019.</p>
<p>The Deribit Insurance fund will not be used to cover these losses, but compensation will be covered by Deribit.</p>
<p>&mdash; Deribit (@DeribitExchange) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeribitExchange/status/1190047067365953536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exchanges such as Binance have</span><a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1190176334837735425https://twitter.com/binance/status/1190176334837735425"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">already advised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their users to modify email addresses if they were also linked to Bitmex. The blunder is a stark reminder to traders to use a unique email address and password for each platform, utilizing a password manager if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PR disaster was compounded when Bitmex&rsquo;s official Twitter handle was briefly compromised, with</span><a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1190253155122106368"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reading &ldquo;Hacked&rdquo; and &ldquo;Take your <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and run. Last day for withdrawals.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a</span><a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/updated-statement-on-the-email-privacy-issue-impacting-our-users/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bitmex cited a software error as the cause of the email breach, and stressed that, beyond email addresses, &ldquo;no other personal data or account information have been disclosed and no further emails have been sent.&rdquo; The statement also urged users to add official Bitmex email addresses to their contact lists and ensure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all their accounts.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#9888;&#65039;We are aware of a large-scale user email leak from another exchange.&#9888;&#65039;</p>
<p>If you are one of the affected users and you also have a Binance account under the same email address, we recommend changing your email immediately using the below steps:<a href="https://t.co/sgEr5sqleg">https://t.co/sgEr5sqleg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1190176334837735425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of Thousands of Addresses Exposed</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitmex deputy COO Vivien Khoo said that while the email was sent to the majority of Bitmex users, not all were affected. According to</span><a href="http://skew.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">skew.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the exchange &ndash; which operates out of Seychelles &ndash; has 22,000 average daily users. Larry Cermak said on</span><a href="https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1190233517784846336"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that &ldquo;30,000 unique emails in total&rdquo; were jeopardized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the leak, Twitter was aflame with panicked users, some enquiring how to delete their Bitmex account and others claiming to have already received crypto spam emails. There was further anger when it emerged that Bitmex requires users to undergo full KYC, including a selfie with their ID and the word &ldquo;Bitmex,&rdquo; in order to change their email address.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well not a good day for <a href="https://twitter.com/BitMEXdotcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BitMEXdotcom</a> <a href="https://t.co/WmZTpRkr3d">pic.twitter.com/WmZTpRkr3d</a></p>
<p>&mdash; WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1190251396727218176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email breach does not come at a good time for Bitmex, which is reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over whether it permits U.S. traders to use its platform. Armed with thousands of user email addresses, the CFTC may well step up its investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reputational and regulatory cost of the blunder is still to be counted. In the interim, neglecting to use blind copy on a mass email has given Bitmex and its normally ebullient CEO Arthur Hayes pause for thought.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We would like to reassure our users that while the trolls may target our Twitter account, you may rest assured that all funds are safe.</p>

<p>After the devastating news of the removal of offline cash trades and the new vigorous and intrusive KYC policy from popular P2P Exchange Platform (Localbitcoins) the community needed an alternative. We&rsquo;re happy to announce the arrival of GlobalBitcoinsPro.com which has been created to revive the community.</p>
<p>Created by a group of OTC traders that grew from trading on Localbitcoins and noticed a decline in the community they were used to, they simply &ldquo;Wanted to bring back the glory days&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GlobalBitcoinsPro.com is a peer-to-peer (p2p) cryptocurrency exchange platform, it is the newest and most reliable platform allowing users to safely perform both online and offline trades. Their main attraction is the familiar, popular and easy to use interface that many traders already know how to use making it easier to just make an account and start creating ads and trading. They also added new and exciting features that serve two communities by offering the choice of trading between <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> (Bitcoin Core) & <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> (Bitcoin Cash). One of their primary objectives is to facilitate the efficient trade of cryptocurrencies on a global scale, which will ultimately result in a digital community coming together. GlobalBitcoinsPro.com has a very convenient, easy to use functionality making the usage of this platform smooth and hassle-free. This platform is available worldwide with active users in multiple countries. They have also competitively slashed fees in half by charging only half a percent as opposed to the competition that charges 1% fees on all trades.</p>
<p>Filling the gap in the market of p2p cryptocurrency trading platforms</p>
<p>After recognising a gap in the market, when the market leaders took down their offline trading features, they decided to fill that gap by recreating a similar platform with added features allowing users to trade with physical cash once again. A popular platform &lsquo;LocalBitcoins&rsquo; took down offline trades early June resulting in numerous complaints and loyal users having no support. GlobalBitcoinsPro.com swiftly filled this and brought offline trades back therefore allowing users to still have an option for either offline and online trades.</p>
<p>Enabling more access to Crypto Currencies in developing countries where banks cannot reach</p>
<p>GlobalBitcoinsPro.com has worked on bringing the world of Crypto Currencies to every city and they are constantly expanding. This allows the access to Crypto Currencies to stretch globally to developing countries that would usually be ignored by the traditional banking world. This is evidently not only a platform just for trading, but they are also looking to advance the community and introducing Crypto to the world economy.</p>

The former IMF Managing Director implored: &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it true that ultimately we have done the right thing to act in favour of jobs and of growth rather than the protection of savers?&rdquo; Regarding former president Mario Draghi and the ECB&rsquo;s negative interest rate policy, she went on to imply that people should be grateful for the job policies, savings protected or not.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Easy for You to Say, Lagarde</h2>
<p>Some commentators were taken aback by the bold remarks <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes/status/1189582776401616901">reported</a> Wednesday, with one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/rodrigopacini/status/1189900578987630598">remarking</a>: &ldquo;translation: You should be happy to be slaves.&rdquo; Another felt Lagarde&rsquo;s words embodied &ldquo;The old mantra to make the tax slaves think they would be jobless without the government protecting them. Propaganda doesn&rsquo;t work when you&rsquo;re enlightened by Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-343767 size-full" title="ECB President: &rsquo;We Should Be Happier to Have a Job Than to Have Our Savings Protected&rsquo;" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23.jpg" alt="ECB President: &rsquo;We Should Be Happier to Have a Job Than to Have Our Savings Protected&rsquo;" width="403" height="403" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23.jpg 403w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23-150x150.jpg 150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-11-01-10-48-23-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<p>In her address, the new ECB leader chided the German and Dutch governments for not investing their budget surpluses in causes she deems worthy, such as infrastructure, education and innovation to &ldquo;allow for a better rebalancing.&rdquo; As far as the common folk go, the bigwig of financial policy noted in blatantly direct fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should be happier to have a job than to have our savings protected &hellip; I think that it is in this spirit that monetary policy has been decided by my predecessors and I think they made quite a beneficial choice.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who Is &lsquo;We&rsquo;? &ndash; Poverty In the EU</h2>
<p>When Lagarde says &ldquo;we&rdquo; one is inclined to wonder who exactly she is talking about. According to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Europe_2020_indicators_-_poverty_and_social_exclusion#General_overview">statistics</a>, 16.9% of EU residents are living at risk of poverty even after welfare and social transfer factors are accounted for as of 2017. Many Europeans may be currently &ldquo;employed,&rdquo; but the nice sounding stats are often bolstered by extremely lax measures of what constitutes said employment. Spotty and unreliable jobs such as someone working only one hour a week still officially serve to make Draghi and Lagarde&rsquo;s rhetoric appear sound. According to the August, 2018 <a href="https://wol.iza.org/articles/measuring-employment-and-unemployment/long">study</a> &ldquo;Measuring employment and unemployment&rdquo; by Bank of Italy researchers Andrea Brandolini and Eliana Viviano:</p>
<blockquote><p>The employment rate is the proportion of the working-age population with a paid job: it is a headcount measure that disregards how working time and contract duration differ across the employed.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the multimillion-dollar-net-worth Lagarde sips champagne in designer clothes and &ldquo;power scarves,&rdquo; the common plebs living paycheck-to-paycheck governed by ECB policy must remain grateful that although their savings are being eaten alive, at least they can work, maybe. Those taking issue with the new negative rate defender at the ECB are not necessarily opposed to high fashion and the good life, as much as the hypocrisy and arrogance required to utter such nonsense in a position like Lagarde&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Savings Are Essential to Healthy Economies</h2>
<p>As American economist Murray Rothbard once wrote, &ldquo;Savings and investment are indissolubly linked. It is impossible to encourage one and discourage the other.&rdquo; Without the ability to save, there is no ability to invest. No chance to build for a future, or to create space by leveraging finance for personal time for innovation, exploration and rest.</p>
<p>Lagarde&rsquo;s proclamation that those nations with surplus should invest, while calling for everyday individuals to essentially quiet down about retaining value, betrays an important disconnect and telling, underlying worldview: money and savings are for us, working is for you.</p>
<p>Ironic that the socialist lawyer from France would take such a position. Looping back around to Bitcoin, the statements also betray something else. The very reason most governments stand opposed to permissionless, decentralized finance and <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/">cryptocurrencies</a> may be that Bitcoin enables saving and spending freely, regardless of what any disconnected third party might think about what should be done with your money.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Miners Talk Bitcoin Halving 2020</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin.com team has recently talked with ten prominent people from the crypto mining industry about the upcoming halving at the World Digital Mining Summit 2019 in Frankfurt. Some think that it might cause miners&rsquo; revenues to crash, others think prices will quickly rise to compensate for the diminished rewards, all agree it will be a pivotal event for the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TjuzBZnhXJU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The full list of mining experts interviewed in the <a href="https://youtu.be/TjuzBZnhXJU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> includes: Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining; Thomas Heller, F2Pool Global Business Director; Sean M. Walsh, CEO & Chairman of the Board, Hyperblock Inc; Dr. Mervyn G. Maistry, Board Member Cyberian Mine; Carson Blake, CEO of SBI Crypto; Alexander Levin, CEO of Asicseer.com; Eric P. Yingling, an independent miner; Nick Damico, CTO at BitPatagonia; Hugh Tian, Co-founder of Antpool; and &Aring;smund Myhre, CEO of Oslofjord Datacenter.</p>
<p>In terms of the professional mining industry it seems we should expect to see a major concentration of the business as the halving will take place. Those with larger hashing power and access to cheaper sources of energy will squeeze out from the market operations that need higher margins to survive and make a profit. &ldquo;The halving is a brutal wipe-out event,&rdquo; explained Marco Streng. &ldquo;It knocks out immediately the miners who are not efficient enough and shows no mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We might also see fluctuations and changes in global hash power distribution during the few weeks that are expected to pass between the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> halving and the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> halving, as SHA-256 miners will switch to the most profitable chain to mine at the time.</p>
<p>With regards to the effect the halving will have on prices opinions are more split. We could see prices double as miners will need to keep their current revenue streams, or even take off not long after as has happened in the past. &ldquo;If you look at six months before the halving and six month after the halving in both previous instances you see massive upward surge in the price of bitcoin,&rdquo; commented Sean Walsh. &ldquo;It is a bit scary being a miner and knowing that your revenue stream is gonna get cut in half over night but the exchange rate will more than compensate for the reduction in our bitcoin denominated revenue.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">What and When Is the Next Halving?</h2>
<p>Every time a new block is mined, those who facilitated it are rewarded with a set amount of coins. But once every 210,000 blocks this set reward amount is programmed to decrease by half, hence the name halving. This mechanism was created by Satoshi Nakamoto to ensure current supply is limited, making coins more scarce as there will never be more than 21 million in circulation. It can also create upward pressure on the price in contrast to most fiat currencies that only lose value over time due to inflation.</p>
<p>The first ever halving took place in 2012 when the block reward initially set to 50 coins fell to just 25. The second and last halving so far took place in 2016 when the block reward dropped from 25 to just 12.5 coins.</p>
<p>The upcoming bitcoin cash halving event is expected to be during April 2020. After this happens, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) and receive just 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and fees per block mined. The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> halving is expected not far after that in May 2020. A German bank recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/german-bank-predicts-btc-at-90000-after-next-halving/">predicted</a> a tenfold increase in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price when the upcoming block reward halving takes place.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones But Words Make It Less Painful</h2>
<p>In George Orwell&rsquo;s classic dystopian novel 1984, the political language called <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/novels/1984/english/en_app">Newspeak</a> existed &ldquo;not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc [the novel&rsquo;s dystopian political system], but to make all other modes of thought impossible.&rdquo; Politicians today employ the same techniques.</p>
<p>Euphemism is designed to make unpalatable realities sound inoffensive or even pleasant. Economic terms like &ldquo;quantitative easing&rdquo; and &ldquo;NIRP&rdquo; don&rsquo;t sound particularly threatening or bad. The underlying realities successfully obfuscated, however, and central bankers are able to proceed with impunity in economic activity extremely damaging to the finances of the hardworking individuals they govern.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">NIRP and ZIRP</h2>
<p>NIRP and ZIRP are acronyms for &ldquo;negative interest rate policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;zero interest rate policy&rdquo; respectively. The acronyms themselves take some of the punch away from the not-so-wonderful meanings, but the expanded terminologies are also misleading. A negative interest rate is commonly known in the real world as a &ldquo;fee.&rdquo; If interest is a payment one receives for lending money to another person, business, or financial institution, negative interest would be a charge for doing so.</p>
<p>With politicians and global financial advisory groups saying things like &ldquo;Over in Europe and Japan they have NEGATIVE RATES. They get paid to borrow money&rdquo; (<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1189198697059553285">Donald Trump</a>), or &ldquo;Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive&rdquo; (the <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/">IMF</a>), the reality of what is being advocated is hidden.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How Does NIRP Work?</h2>
<p>Negative interest rates are set by a country&rsquo;s central bank. They spur spending and discourage saving. Banks cannot afford to leave excess reserves being eaten away in the central bank at these rates, and are thus incentivized to provide more affordable loans. Some retail banks absorb this cost to keep their depositors from moving savings into cash; other banks <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/major-german-coop-bank-passes-negative-interest-rates-to-customers/">charge their customers</a>. The low rates and increased loans mean that more people borrow and spend, and the now stimulated economy is thus viewed as &ldquo;strong&rdquo; (more newspeak), juiced up on the speed-like drug of increased easy lending. The printing of more money can then justified under this pretext. At some point, however, the chickens of these policies come home to roost, as sound assets and resources are limited, no matter how much paper money a government prints.</p>
<p>ZIRP is the only slightly more conservative cousin of stimulus-addicted NIRP, and is a zero interest rate policy set by a country&rsquo;s central bank. Unlike NIRP, zero is the limit as to how low <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalinterestrate.asp">nominal rates</a> can be set, and so other measures such as quantitative easing are often implemented.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Quantitative Easing</h2>
<p>When zero interest rate policy fails to stimulate an economy adequately, QE, or quantitative easing, may be employed in conjunction. QE is the creation of more money by a central bank, temporarily easing the stress on a given economy. In QE, central banks create more reserves to buy debt and securities from their governments and sometimes even private entities. As finance website thebalance.com <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-quantitative-easing-definition-and-explanation-3305881">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>No funds change hands but the central bank issues a credit to the banks&rsquo; reserves as it buys the securities. QE has the same effect as increasing the money supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the domestic money supply increased, economic activity is expected to be stimulated. Like the NIRP and ZIRP policies detailed above, however, it&rsquo;s akin to taking an aspirin for a serious disease, or buying more credit cards to pay off the pile of old, already maxed-out plastic in one&rsquo;s wallet.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343576" style="width: 1164px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343576 size-full" title="Do You Know the Newspeak of the Looming 'NIRP' Economic Meltdown?" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2.jpg" alt="Do You Know the Newspeak of the Looming 'NIRP' Economic Meltdown?" width="1164" height="396" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2.jpg 1164w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2-300x102.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2-768x261.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2-1024x348.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2-696x237.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ppp2-1068x363.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1164px) 100vw, 1164px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343576" class="wp-caption-text">St. Louis Federal Reserve</figcaption></figure>
<p>An increased money supply means higher inflation and the resultant loss of purchasing power. In case QE fails to provide a shot in the arm to a given economy, a phenomenon known as stagflation can also occur where inflation continues in the absence of economic growth. It may seem surprising to consider many world leaders, central banks and financial planners are now praising and implementing policies designed to make money weaker in the name of progress, but that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Don&rsquo;t we have to follow our competitors?&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/Varneyco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Varneyco</a> Yes we do. The Fed doesn&rsquo;t have a clue! We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve. But we are winning anyway!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The NIRP Zeitgeist</h2>
<p>In its Global Banking Annual Review 2019, management consulting firm McKinsey & Company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mckinsey-majority-of-banks-may-not-be-economically-viable/">claimed</a> that &ldquo;60 percent of banks destroy value&rdquo; as they are not economically viable. From 2009 to 2018, most banks studied showed a return on equity (ROE) less than their cost of equity (COE). In other words, they are not making ends meet and in the case of another crisis like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">global downturn</a> sparked in the late 2000s, may not survive.</p>
<p>Global trends toward negative rates and easing are nevertheless touted by policy makers as necessary. According to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-research-considers-negative-interest-rates-effective-policy-tool/">research</a> by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, &ldquo;Central banks that have yet to introduce negative rates may take some comfort from this evidence as there appears to be room below zero for additional economic stimulus.&rdquo; The media is complicit in being the megaphone for these concepts of endless easing and low rates as well, with even respected financial publications <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/normalizing-negative-interest-its-flabbergasting-how-closely-media-parrots-the-government/">praising</a> such moves. None of the pretty language, of course, changes the stark reality underneath.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rearranging Deck Chairs on the Titanic</h2>
<p>To see where all this is potentially heading, one only needs to look back at the long list of countries where inflation has already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/3-major-signs-that-precede-the-fall-of-world-reserve-currencies/">spiraled out of control</a>, and the current talk from global monetary policymakers and central banks. While many countries have suffered independently before, the timing now suggests a broader, more global financial meltdown could be on the horizon.</p>
<p>Leadership at the European Central Bank continue to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mario-draghi-leaves-european-central-bank-without-ever-raising-interest-rates/">praise</a> and advocate for the extension of NIRP and ZIRP policy. Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark don&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;ll be escaping their deepening, respective NIRP sloughs anytime soon. The U.S., Australia and New Zealand&rsquo;s rates are all rapidly approaching zero, and New Zealand&rsquo;s central bank is even considering <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/114923477/why-reserve-bank-governor-adrian-orr-prefers-negative-interest-rates-to-qe">taxing cash</a> to force people to spend and discourage saving.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/">maintained</a> in February 2019:</p>
<blockquote><p>Severe recessions have historically required 3&ndash;6 percentage points cut in policy rates. If another crisis happens, few countries would have that kind of room for monetary policy to respond.</p></blockquote>
<p>As rates are already so low globally, another recession could spell real disaster. One of the IMF&rsquo;s proposed solutions was to even eliminate cash, another emergent global theme.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, central bankers appear to be playing a board game. When the colorful strips of play money run out, the banker just writes some numbers on blank pieces paper and the game goes on. In Monopoly, this is all for the sake of fun and leisure. In reality, it&rsquo;s a game being played with people&rsquo;s very livelihoods, by saccharine-tongued politicians and central bank governors who have nothing to lose by gambling your money away.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The 11th Anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper</h2>
<p>11 years ago today, at 2:10 p.m. Eastern Standard, Satoshi Nakamoto published the <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> to the Cryptography Mailing List. The service used was a pipermail message service hosted on metzdowd.com run by a group of cypherpunks. The mailing list message title was called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper</a>&rdquo; and Nakamoto explained that he had been &ldquo;working on a new electronic cash system that&rsquo;s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.&rdquo; The anonymous creator also revealed that the paper was hosted on the website bitcoin.org.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343723" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343723 size-full" title="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg.jpg" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" width="1500" height="450" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-300x90.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-768x230.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1024x307.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-696x209.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1392x418.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1068x320.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hallowmsg-1400x420.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343723" class="wp-caption-text">The first group of people Satoshi showed his project to were the cypherpunks using the Cryptography Mailing List hosted on metzdowd.com.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nakamoto emphasized in his email that the main property of the protocol was that &ldquo;double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.&rdquo; He highlighted that there was no mint or trusted third parties and &ldquo;participants can be anonymous&rdquo; if they choose to be. The first email detailed that &ldquo;new coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work and the proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the network to prevent double-spending.&rdquo;</p>
<figure id="attachment_343720" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343720" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343720 size-full" title="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump.jpg" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" width="1500" height="900" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-300x180.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-768x461.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-696x418.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-1392x835.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoinpump-700x420.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343720" class="wp-caption-text">On the eve of Halloween on October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper for the first time. More than a decade later there are 3,000+ digital currencies in existence following Bitcoin&rsquo;s initial launch.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Bitcoin whitepaper announcement wasn&rsquo;t a huge deal at the time and really only a small number of people witnessed the message and replied. So three days later on November 3, 2008, he decided to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014815.html">write the mailing list again</a> pitching the newly published paper. The Bitcoin inventor mentioned some of the same things that were said in the previous message published on Halloween. A few people had replied to Satoshi at the time and one individual seemed to like the idea, but he didn&rsquo;t think Bitcoin could scale. Nakamoto dismissed the scaling issue casually and said: &ldquo;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.&rdquo; Nakamoto continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&lsquo;P2P Networks Seem to Be Holding Their Own&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Nakamoto also mentioned concepts like Moore&rsquo;s Law and told the person that it would take several years for the network to grow extremely massive and &ldquo;by then, sending 2 HD movies over the internet would probably not seem like a big deal.&rdquo; The same day, Nakamoto <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014818.html">replied</a> again in regard to a few attack theories that could be associated with dishonest nodes. Again being the master of his craft, Nakamoto quickly replied and explained that if a &ldquo;bad guy does overpower the network&rdquo; the miner would have to outpace the system and it would be much like &ldquo;bouncing a check.&rdquo; &ldquo;To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back. I don&rsquo;t think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins,&rdquo; Nakamoto stressed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343717" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343717 size-full" title="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1.jpg" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's Powerful Bitcoin White Paper Turns 11" width="1500" height="750" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1.jpg 1500w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-1392x696.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p2p-1-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343717" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">If you haven&rsquo;t read the Bitcoin whitepaper you can read it here.</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>More than a decade later, the Bitcoin network and the cryptocurrency ecosystem have grown massive. There are more than <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">3,000 digital currencies</a> listed on market capitalization websites and there&rsquo;s roughly a quarter of a trillion dollars in digital currency value being held by people worldwide. Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s paper and the network that went online the following January created a system of wealth that transcends borders, governments, and corporate control. Nakamoto highlighted two days after his third email that Bitcoin was merely an efficient tool and it wasn&rsquo;t the cure-all against the <a href="https://www.mensenrechten.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-most-dangerous-superstition-larken-rose-20111.pdf">monopolistic system of force</a> that still exists in society today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,&rdquo; Nakamoto <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014823.html">remarked</a> on November 6. &ldquo;But we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far his forecast has been true and Bitcoin has ushered in a new form of money and a taste of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire">true laissez-faire</a>. People have been able to use bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to bypass state laws, sanctions, capital controls, and help people who need funds without restrictions. Since the birth of cryptographic currency, many other ideas have stemmed from the technological innovation and people are focused on building platforms like decentralized exchanges and concepts that utilize zero-knowledge proofs. The 11th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper reminds people how powerful Nakamoto&rsquo;s invention still is to this day and how it continues to transform the world of finance as we know it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Presidential Committee Pushes for Crypto Legalization</h2>
<p>The South Korean Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (PCFIR), directly under the president, has made several recommendations regarding the country&rsquo;s cryptocurrency regulation. The PCFIR coordinates policies and reviews matters pertaining to the national master plans and strategies related to the &ldquo;fourth industrial revolution,&rdquo; which refers to a highly connected economy supported by advances in areas such as blockchain, 5G, artificial intelligence, big data, and the internet of things.</p>
<p>At the committee&rsquo;s global policy conference in Seoul on Oct. 25, PCFIR Chairman Chang Byung-gyu said &ldquo;the government needs to establish the legal status of crypto assets,&rdquo; several local media outlets quoted him as saying.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343591" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343591" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343591 size-full" title="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee.jpg" alt="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/presidential-committee-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343591" class="wp-caption-text">The Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution at its Oct. 25 global policy conference.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Emphasizing that the country&rsquo;s regulations and administrative procedures must be improved to foster innovative startups, Chang stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The legal status of crypto assets should be established as soon as possible, and tax and accounting measures should be taken.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Call for Changes Under New FSC Chairman</h2>
<p>The committee also urged the government to promote innovation and the institutionalization of crypto assets in order to stay competitive globally. However, so far, the government has opposed the idea due to concerns of possible side effects raised by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Information, an industry stakeholder told MSN news outlet.</p>
<p>The PCFIR criticized the government&rsquo;s current crypto policies of focusing primarily on curbing speculation and reducing the kimchi premium, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The government&rsquo;s deterrence policy, which is indispensable to the cryptocurrency speculation fever, is reducing our global competitiveness in the blockchain and crypto-asset industries &hellip; We need to set policy goals to preempt future opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Led by former chairman Choi Jong-ku, South Korea&rsquo;s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) implemented emergency cryptocurrency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-emergency-cryptocurrency-regulation/">measures</a> in December 2017 in order to curb the kimchi premium. Several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-releases-official-guidelines-cryptocurrency-exchanges-banks/">follow-up measures</a> were introduced over the next few months, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-ends-anonymous-cryptocurrency-trading/">real-name system</a> in January last year. However, only the country&rsquo;s top four crypto exchanges have been able to use the system so far.</p>
<figure id="attachment_343594" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-343594" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-343594 size-full" title="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo.jpg" alt="Korean Presidential Committee Pushes to Legalize Crypto" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eun-sung-soo-840x420.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-343594" class="wp-caption-text">New FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Choi is no longer the chairman of the FSC. He was succeeded by Eun Sung-soo on Sept. 9. Prior to his appointment, Eun served as the president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of Korea and led the Korea Investment Corporation, Korea&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, from January 2016 to September 2017.</p>
<p>After the PCFIR announced its crypto recommendations, Lee Kong-joo, Advisor to the President for Science and Technology, thanked the committee for its efforts, the Bchain publication detailed, quoting him as saying, &ldquo;I will actively consider ways to make these [recommendations] possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hankyoreh reported on Oct. 27 that the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, under the FSC&rsquo;s supervision, said that it will beef up crypto regulations in compliance with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The announcement followed a recent FATF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-starts-checking-how-well-countries-implement-crypto-standards/">plenary meeting</a>. The FATF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-global-standards-crypto-assets/">issued guidance</a> on crypto assets and related service providers in June and is currently evaluating how well its member countries are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-starts-checking-how-well-countries-implement-crypto-standards/">applying the guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">You Can Now Get Paid With Bitcoin Cash</h2>
<p>International cryptocurrency payroll and human resources service provider <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-companies-can-now-settle-payroll-taxes-in-cryptocurrency-via-bitwage/">Bitwage</a> has recently announced the launch of bitcoin cash payrolls. This means that anyone working for a U.S., EU or U.K. employer can now receive a portion of their wage in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> by signing up to the service. Companies can also sign up to fund payrolls in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> or to offer <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> to their employees and freelancers.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-343616" title="US, EU and UK Companies Can Now Pay Workers in Bitcoin Cash via Bitwage" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1024x512.jpg" alt="US, EU and UK Companies Can Now Pay Workers in Bitcoin Cash via Bitwage" width="696" height="348" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-300x150.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-768x384.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-696x348.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1392x696.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage-840x420.jpg 840w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitwage.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></a></p>
<p>Earlier this year the company expanded beyond just <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> by launching support for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> payrolls. Shortly after that it took a customer survey to learn what else its users wanted and discovered that there was demand more cryptocurrency payment options. Bitcoin cash, as a consistent top four digital asset, offering low fees and fast transactions, was a natural choice to add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, employees and freelancers are looking to diversify their portfolio of cryptocurrency,&rdquo; <a href="https://blog.bitwage.com/2019/10/29/bitwage-launches-bitcoin-cash-payrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> Bitwage CEO Jonathan Chester. &ldquo;Bitwage is making it easier for workers around the world to accumulate their favorite cryptocurrency, through passive dollar-cost-averaging.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bitwage Is Used by Workers at Facebook, Google and Uber</h2>
<p>Bitwage has been providing direct bitcoin deposits since 2014, and reportedly already serves over 30,000 people including employees, freelancers and independent contractors. It has also reportedly raised around $1 million in total funding from a number of investors such as Draper Associates, Orange and BPI France.</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s website, the service has been used by workers of Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, American Express, GE, Comcast and other corporations as well as public institutions such as the World Health Organization. Coinciding with the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> launch, Bitcoin.com has now onboarded as an initial customer, Bitwage revealed.</p>

Of course, the reality is that China&rsquo;s marked shift towards pro-blockchain policies is part of a much wider trend which has seen Asian multinationals and governments embrace the considerable potential of distributed ledger technologies.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Two-Year Turnaround</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Xi&rsquo;s announcement centered on the creation of a state-backed digital currency (a stablecoin tied to the renminbi), an idea which has been gestating since the country&rsquo;s central bank started exploring the possibility as far back as 2014. With the dawn of a new decade, a law will come into effect on January 1 with the aim of &ldquo;facilitating the development of the cryptography business and ensuring the security of cyberspace and information.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-326109" title="The Xi Effect &ndash; Chinese Government to Fund Blockchain Projects" src="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china.png" alt="The Xi Effect &ndash; Chinese Government to Fund Blockchain Projects" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china.png 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-300x150.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-768x384.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-696x348.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/china-840x420.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is predicted that the currency in question will launch soon after, although perhaps the possibility of blockchain technologies powering the continued transformation of China&rsquo;s vast industries is of greater significance. Xi specifically mentioned that the technology could be applied to realms including finance, public services, employment, education and infrastructure management. It&rsquo;s all a far cry from 2017, when the government imposed a general ban on all crypto businesses and exchanges. From deep suspicion, to a state-supervised (albeit heavily surveilled) cryptocurrency, in just two years is quite a turnaround.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after the announcement was made, the local government of Guangzhou announced</span><a href="https://newslogical.com/chinese-local-government-to-release-150m-blockchain-project-fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a $150 million fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for outstanding blockchain projects, with more initiatives expected in the near future. </span></p>

On the markets, some of this week&rsquo;s biggest beneficiaries have been Chinese blockchains, even if there&rsquo;s nothing to suggest they&rsquo;re due to receive an influx of fresh business from government enterprises. In fact, six of the seven best-performing crypto assets in the top 50 this week have Chinese origins.

As well as facilitating the creation of decentralized applications (dapps) running on the Tron ecosystem, the Keystore will let users access and trade <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a> directly from the wallet on their handset. Perhaps coincidentally, industry sources are mulling over rumours that Samsung is </span><a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2019/10/133_277813.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outsourcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a part of its smartphone manufacturing to China.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung has been experimenting with blockchain technologies for some time now, and with their growing dapp arsenal, their long-term strategy seems positively crypto-centric. It isn&rsquo;t the only smartphone company testing the blockchain waters either; Taiwanese electronics giant HTC has also invested heavily in decentralized services and a blockchain-powered handset, the Exodus 1, and its successor, the 1s, which can run a full Bitcoin node.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Next for China?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term effect of China&rsquo;s increasingly pro-blockchain outlook remains to be seen, and until its state cryptocurrency is hatched and various policies put into action, we won&rsquo;t be able to quantify the consequences for blockchain technology and digital currencies more generally. That said, interest in the region is largely unrelated to the President&rsquo;s ringing endorsement; according to a report by the Financial Times, Chinese companies have filed more patents on blockchain than companies from any other region in the world. A significant percentage of bitcoin mining is concentrated in the region, and many of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges are either based or were founded in the Asian continent, from Beijing and Singapore to Hong Kong and Tokyo. Regardless of its real ramifications, Asian crypto companies were never going to let President Xi&rsquo;s decree go to waste.</span></p>

Every day we would hear about a new venture that supposedly signed a partnership with a global brand such as Microsoft or Google, to make us think that these tech giants were backing the idea. In reality most of the time it was just a trivial matter such as allowing the project to use free services from the tech giant, as countless other startups do. The tactic is still used today and crypto investors need to keep in mind that it is not a guarantee for success. </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Big Name Pumping</h2>
<p>As if crypto investors have learned nothing over the past few years, some project promoters continue to try and push their tokens with announcements about big name partnerships. These normal business agreements can be used sometimes to hint, insinuate or even predict a price rise of a related token in an irresponsible way. Companies and startups make a lot of agreements to cooperate with one another and these are not a guarantee of a deal that will bring in more money or users.</p>
<p>Additionally, doing so isn&rsquo;t just potentially misleading to investors &ndash; it can also be very detrimental to the projects themselves. Authorities around the world such as the U.S. SEC and Chinese financial regulators are actively seeking to make examples out of ICOs and crypto ventures to tarnish the whole industry as promoting unregistered securities. Making grandiose partnership statements with the intended purpose of pumping a token is providing them with ammunition.</p>

Last week he tweeted about a deal with a hundred billion dollar &ldquo;mega corporation&rdquo; that will &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; the native tokens of Tron, Bittorrent and Wink. Many traders indeed responded positively to the news by buying the coins, despite widespread cynicism on crypto forums about all the previous hype from the Tron founder. On Tuesday he revealed that the company&rsquo;s blockchain is now integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore SDK, meaning that smartphone app developers can build services running on the system like they already can with its main competitor, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">High Profile Partnerships Are No Guarantee for Success</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors need to keep in mind that all ventures in this ecosystem are highly risky investments and there is no certainty that the ICO token or other digital asset you invested in will be still valuable in two or three years. The absolute majority of technological startups in all fields don&rsquo;t survive, with venture capital industry estimates of over 90% failure rate.</p>
<p>This can be despite having a smart team, brilliant idea or great technological innovation. At the end of the day, what matters for all businesses is if you can get enough paying costumers to cover the bills and make a profit. Without this you are just burning investors&rsquo; money until further investment comes in or you have to shut down. Partnerships that don&rsquo;t bring in new money or paying clients won&rsquo;t change that.</p>

<p>In the digital assets field in particular, with the lingering effects of crypto winter, many projects that once seemed promising are these days find themselves forced to shut down. A recent example of this is Platin, a secure Proof of Location protocol which incentivizes nodes at scale by means of its own blockchain-based token. On Monday the team announced on <a href="https://medium.com/@platin_io/a-letter-to-the-platin-community-9cb603b3d0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a> that the company will be shutting down on November 1, 2019, after which all services will no longer be available. This is despite all the recognition from big names it got over the last two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Japan noticed as Platin was selected by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as one of the world&rsquo;s leading blockchain innovations. Germany noticed as its Startup Autobahn selected Platin to showcase proof of location to Mercedes Benz, Rolls Royce, Porsche and other automotive giants,&rdquo; the final letter from the team recounted. &ldquo;IBM noticed as it selected Platin for its AlphaZONE technology accelerator. The European Space agency noticed as they admitted Platin to the Galileo Positioning System Task Force. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a> and Block.one noticed as they invested in Platin and showcased our technology on the world stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, at the end the founders explained that &ldquo;One of the biggest challenges we faced was how to continue pushing forward while our resources were dwindling and turbulent market forces weren&rsquo;t providing a stable environment in which to operate. We did everything in our power to extend Platin&rsquo;s operations as far as we could, month after month, continually bootstrapping in the face of great uncertainty. In addition to developing Platin&rsquo;s visionary technologies, we worked hard every day to secure the next round of funding, which always seemed to be just around the corner. Unfortunately, we weren&rsquo;t able to get there in time.&rdquo;</p>
